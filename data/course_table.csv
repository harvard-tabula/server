Historical Sociology: Cultural and Institutional Perspectives,"The seminar explores the emergence, dynamics and interaction of cultural, structural and institutional processes in the development, and underdevelopment, of capitalism in selected western and non-western societies. Among the topics explored, through close study of selected texts, are: merchant capital, network channeling and cultural change in renaissance Italy; institutional, cultural and imperial factors in the rise and divergence of West European capitalism; networks and informal institutions in the rise of capitalism in China; cultural and institutional change in Tokugawa Japan; and the institutional and cultural origins of development and underdevelopment in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our readings and discussions will be guided by the recurring theoretical problems of causality, origins, continuity and change in institutional and cultural processes and the fundamental problem of how the past influences later periods and present outcomes.",137,SOCIOL 263,4712
Dreams: Our Mind by Night,"John Steinbeck wrote: &quot;It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.&quot;&nbsp; Steinbeck doesn&rsquo;t name the dream as spokesperson for the Committee of Sleep.&nbsp; However, most stories of nocturnal problem solving involve dreams. They are documented to have given the waking world one Nobel laureate&rsquo;s scientific experiment, music from classical masterpieces to pop chartbusters, innumerable novels and paintings, and inventions from the automated sewing machine to the computerized anti-aircraft gun. This course examines dreams with an emphasis on their relation to the creative process and problem solving. We&rsquo;ll first read about a variety of psychological aspects of dreaming&mdash;neurophysiology, biochemical, clinical, personality, and lucid dreaming research. The course also includes perspectives from history, religion, art, literature, and anthropology. In the later part we&rsquo;ll focus on the phenomena of problem solving and creativity in dreams&mdash;both the historic anecdotes and modern research on college students attempting to &lsquo;incubate&rsquo; problem-solving dreams and how this may relate to which brain areas are active during dreaming sleep. We&rsquo;ll visit a sleep laboratory and a dream artist&rsquo;s studio. You&rsquo;ll get a chance to work with your own dreams&mdash;in at-home assignments and also in class exercises. You&rsquo;ll keep a dream journal for the first half of the course, participate in experiential dreamwork exercises, and write a term paper to explore a topic of your choice in more depth.",56,FRSEMR 26F,1808
Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education,"Events such as Teach for America's 20th anniversary and films like Waiting for Superman highlight urgent concerns about the quality and reach of American schooling in the 21st century.

Sense and Scientific Sensibility,"Scientific inquiry is often considered an endeavor pursued using one's sense of vision: scientists peer into microscopes and telescopes, and stare at graphs, diagrams, and computer screens. But on what other senses do scientists rely? How do they gather data using senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch (or, for that matter, less acknowledged perceptual systems, among them, balance, temperature, movement, pain, and time)? How do researchers evaluate sensory evidence? Further, what is the history of scientific studies of the senses? To address such questions, each week we will explore a different sense (from the canonical five to synaesthesia and ESP) by combining readings in the history of science with classic primary sources. Throughout, we will examine critical questions regarding how the senses are culturally and historically constructed, evaluated, and technologically mediated.",76,HISTSCI 164,2664

Molecular Aspects of Chromatin Dynamics,"This course will discuss the role of chromatin dynamics in modulating molecular and cellular processes. The genetic information encoded in our DNA is organized in a defined set of chromosomes, which are condensed about 10.000 fold in order to fit in the cell nucleus. This compaction occurs through packaging of the DNA around histone proteins, a structure known as chromatin. In what was thought to be a rigid structure, today we know that chromatin is an amazingly dynamic folding that plays a crucial role in controlling accessibility of factors to the DNA, and as such, it regulates a vast number of critical biological functions, including gene transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair and cellular identity. In this course we will attempt to cover some of the basic molecular mechanisms that play a role in regulating chromatin dynamics, and in turn how chromatin itself modulate biological processes, including basic mechanisms of inheritance. We will specifically discuss the role of DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome dynamics and novel epigenetic modulators in the context of different biological processes for which chromatin accessibility appears to play a crucial role.",84,CELLBIO 307QC,3024

"Protestant-Catholic Relations in America, 1600-2000","With the earliest colonists to the Americas came the legacy of the great divide that separated Protestants from Catholics during the Reformation. From that time forward, the relationship between these groups has been central to the American experiment, shaping the contours of American democracy and national identity. This course will explore the complex and continuously evolving interplay between Protestants and Catholics and its influence on American history, literature, thought, politics, and culture. Anti-Catholicism will figure prominently in the readings and lectures, but so too will such themes as agency, cross-confessional exchange, and definition in opposition. We will pay particular attention to the waxing and waning of anti-Catholicism at different points in American history; changing conceptions of democracy, religious pluralism, secularism, church-state relations, and the category of religion itself; the distinctive contributions of Protestants and Catholics to American social movements; and the growing affinities between evangelical Protestants and Catholics in contemporary America.",160,RELIGION 1480,5076

Human Brain in Health and Disease: A Neurologist's Perspective,"Is the human mind an &ldquo;emergent&rdquo; property of the brain?&nbsp; How might that occur?&nbsp; We study how structure and properties of the brain and mind are shaped by biology, chemistry, experience and disease. For example, experiences during &quot;critical periods&quot; modify brain anatomy/function; learning a foreign language before or after puberty is revealed by a native or foreign accent. Mirror neurons play a role in perception, motor skills and emotion. Examples include &quot;contagious&quot; happiness or sadness, empathy and theory of mind; their dysfunction may cause autism. Beyond these &ldquo;bottoms up&rdquo; explanations, we will also consider a &ldquo;top down&rdquo; approach, in which the intention or purpose of a behavior or idea can &ldquo;pull&rdquo; our behavior or state of mind, what Aristotle termed &ldquo;Final Cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; The human brain/mind is a pattern-seeking organ that uses logical patterns to predict the future.&nbsp; From infancy we make sense of the world by seeking logical patterns; mathematics is &ldquo;core knowledge&rdquo; of infants.&nbsp; We then use these patterns to look into the future to anticipate where a given pattern will lead and are thus &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; to that goal or not; thus the goal can determine behavior and worldview.&nbsp; We read Victor Frankl&#39;s &quot;Man&#39;s Search for Meaning&quot; which explores human thought, behavior and purpose. This seminar straddles the realms of science, which asks &ldquo;how?&rdquo; and the humanities, which traditionally asks &ldquo;why?&rdquo; and strives to reconcile these two approaches to understanding the world and our place in it.",56,FRSEMR 25X,1806

Forced to be Free: Americans as Occupiers and Nation-Builders,"The United States has launched numerous projects of military occupation and nation-building in foreign lands since the late 19th century. These have been contradictory enterprises, carrying ideals of freedom and self-determination ""offered"" by force or by fiat. This course will assess the meanings and legacies of these projects by examining the ideas, strategies, policies, and outcomes of occupations ranging from the Philippines and Haiti early on, to Japan, Germany, and Korea in mid-century to, most recently, Afghanistan and Iraq. The course focuses on American activities and ideas but also examines the responses of the occupied.",64,US-WORLD 38,2084
How Did the First Stars and Galaxies Form?,"Since the Universe is expanding, it must have been denser in the past. But even before we get all the way back to the Big Bang, there must have been a time when stars like our Sun or galaxies like our own Milky Way did not exist because the Universe was denser than they are. We therefore face the important question about our origins: how and when did the first stars and galaxies form? Primitive versions of this question were considered by humans in religious and philosophical texts for thousands of years, long before it was realized that the Universe expands. The Seminar will summarize the fundamental principles and scientific ideas that are being used to address this question in modern cosmology. Previous generations of scholars have also wondered about the long-term future of the Universe. For the first time in history, we now have a standard cosmological model that agrees with a large body of data about the past history of the Universe. The Seminar will conclude with the forecast that this scientific model makes about our future. The Seminar will be based on a book with the same title written by Professor Loeb (Princeton University Press, 2010).",56,FRSEMR 21G,1766

Autism,"Autism is an increasingly common disorder, frequently found in the popular press and Hollywood movies. It affects roughly 1:100 individuals, approximately 500 times the rate of just a few decades ago. Sadly, despite the considerable financial resources devoted to the study of autism we still do not know what causes the disorder, why its severity varies so enormously from person to person and how best to treat it. This seminar will be broad in scope, focusing on the following key themes: genetic, neurological and possibly environmental causes of autism, risk factors for developing the disorder, best way to characterize the disorder, best treatment options.",56,FRSEMR 25E,1794
You and Your Camera,"The goal of representing the 3-dimensional world on a 2-dimensional surface dates back at least 30,000 years.&nbsp; For nearly all of these past centuries there were relatively few people who had the talent to create realistic 2-dimensional images of the people and things that wanted preservation. Although photography has changed this there are still significant differences between the images that most people create and the photographs of leading photographers.&nbsp; The hope is that this seminar will give students the tools to improve their photographs. After a brief review of the historical review of art and photography the seminar will proceed to discuss the components of a modern camera, what the components are and how they work. Topics to be covered include both the physical optics of simple and compound lenses as well as the quantum physics that is the basis of the electronic devices that are fundamental to digital photography. The differences between the RAW, JPEG and TIFF methods for storing digital photographs will be discussed along with artifacts such as the aliasing that can arise in the digitization of images. Exercises will include, amongst other things, how to manipulate images using the open source GIMP software. An essential issue for color photography is the manner in which the human visual system transforms the wavelength information in the light entering the eye into perceptions of color. The seminar will explain the trichromatic theory of color vision and then discuss the management systems for color printing.",56,FRSEMR 34O,1831
The Art of Noticing,"This is an advanced writing course on writing about poetry, music and art. The assumption of the course is that noticing is a mental discipline like any other and can be cultivated by good habits, exercises and practice. Noticing is also the one basic mental practice shared by the sciences and the humanities, and is indispensable to both. The word &#39;aesthetics&#39; is from the Greek word for &#39;perception&#39;&mdash;arguably interpretable as &#39;noticing.&#39; After the eighteenth century, aesthetics came to mean philosophical meditation on art. But in this course aesthetics means the art of noticing things one doesn&rsquo;t normally see, and deciding which of these things is important. We will be examining together in the classroom poems and works of visual art, and there will be outings to the Harvard Art Museums, the Museum of Natural History as well as to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Evaluation will be based on writing done in and out of class in a journal each student will be required to keep. Journals and papers will be turned in at the end of the class for a cumulative evaluation interview.",56,FRSEMR 34S,1832
"History, Nationalism, and the World: the Case of Korea",The colonialism and postcolonial division of Korea into North and South thrust the memory of past events into current political discussions as well as scholarly debates.

American Fetish: Consumer Culture Encounters the Other,"How are notions of human difference, including ethnicity, race, gender, and sexuality, used to sell products in an increasingly global market? We will start in the nineteenth century with the rise of consumer culture, examining how cultures and people considered ""primitive"" achieved value as objects for exchange and entertainment, and then investigate how this idea takes shape in our contemporary moment. Topics include: sex tourism; commodification of ""queer"" and multiracial aesthetics; ""compassionate"" consumption.",149,WOMGEN 1424,4930
Building a Living Cell One Brick at a Time,"Synthetic biology is an emerging multi-disciplinary field of research aimed at developing solutions to problems impacting our individual lives and ultimately our long-term survival as a species. Some challenges can be addressed by the development of microorganisms re-engineered to perform new functions.&nbsp; New fast and effective methods to sequence the genome of re-engineered bacteria have been developed.&nbsp; In this &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; laboratory course, students will modify the genome of E. coli and study the inner workings of nanopore sequencing, a method allowing for the fast sequencing of entire bacterial genomes. The course gives students the experience of how science is done and how technologies are developed through the practice of experimental inquiry. To understand how a synthetic biological system is built, students will learn how to design experiments and then test their designs.&nbsp; To understand how nanopore technology was developed and how the commercially available nanopore-sequencing instrument works, students will perform experiments illustrating the guiding scientific principles behind this technology.&nbsp; The weekly meetings will include short discussions of selected topics and a discussion of the planned experiments. During the 3-hour laboratory sessions, teams of students will have access to a fully equipped laboratory dedicated to undergraduate research and will perform experiments that they design during previous class meetings. This course will show how a multidisciplinary approach contributes to today&#39;s scientific discoveries.&nbsp; Students will have flexible access to the teaching laboratory to continue their experiments outside of the hours scheduled for the seminar.",56,FRSEMR 25O,1800
Why We Animals Sing,"We do not sing alone. On land, four kinds of animals produce songs or calls: birds, frogs, mammals, and insects. Some of these (and fish) also do so underwater. The principal sounds such animal species make are signaling behaviors directly related to mating success. They are of individuals, usually males, marking territories, and wooing mates. However, in any one location, species may also compete with one another for occupation of acoustic space (that is, for bandwidth) and otherwise optimize their sound signals to features of their environment. We will explore these topics and others as we listen to and read about each of the various kinds of singers on earth, the biology of their sound production and reception, and the ways they attract mates while avoiding becoming meals for eavesdropping predators. We will listen to many different kinds of acoustic signalers across a wide array of acoustic communities in tropical and temperate settings, both terrestrial and aquatic, and we will examine sound spectra on a large screen as we listen and slow down and isolate sounds to help distinguish their parts. Finally, we will consider the biology and evolution of music in humans, considering evidence from brain studies, archaeology and anthropology, and the music of indigenous peoples. We will look at music parallels in different kinds in animals of other species. There will be field trips to listen to and record assemblages of local species. The overall objective is to awaken the students&rsquo; sense, understanding, and appreciation of the acoustic environment from which we come, and the role of this environment in shaping human biology and culture. There is a fair bit of reading required in preparation for weekly discussions. Accordingly, participation will be expected for discussion of the readings and listening experiences.",56,FRSEMR 22T,13448
Permutation and Resampling Based Statistical Methods,"Bootstrap and resampling allow for principled data analysis in diverse areas such as social, biological, or physical sciences. We will implement methods in R, conduct simulation studies, tackle applied projects, and do theoretical work.",147,STAT 242,4854
Understanding Emotions,"Large and small, simple and complex, self-evident and confusing, emotions in all their variety are a fundamental part of life. But just what are emotions? Are they the same in all cultures? What, if any, functions do they serve? Can we control our emotions? What role do they play in development, personality, relationships and well-being? What effects can they have on physical health? And do they present special challenges to scientific study? This seminar will take up these and other fundamental questions, and will discuss methods used to study emotion and the current state of knowledge about human emotion.",56,FRSEMR 25Q,1802
Seeing Time in the Brain,"Time critically shapes our perceptual experience, yet how the brain represents time is poorly understood. This course investigates the experience of time from multiple perspectives, focusing on a systems-level analysis of visual time perception. Topics include illusions of time, neuronal mechanisms of time, the meaning of timescales, models of time perception, and the influence of expectation on brain activity.",91,NEUROBIO 101HFF,3917
"Beyond the Sound Bite: Women, Gender, and Sexuality in The Daily News","We are bombarded by sound bites from all over the globe, moving at disorienting speeds, reorganizing our relationship to time and space with increasingly dystopic results.

Advanced Topics in British Empiricism,"The so-called British Empiricists (Locke, Berkeley, and Hume) take us on a journey from very sensible philosophical starting points to rather extravagant sounding philosophical conclusions. In this course we will look in depth at specific interpretive and philosophical issues that arise in connection with the British Empiricist tradition. Familiarity with the central works of Locke, Berkeley and Hume - such as one might acquire in Phil 122 or a similar course - will be presupposed.",122,PHIL 224,4069

Screens: Media Archaeology and Visual Arts Seminar,"How do screens function as interface between us and the world? What is the role of the screen in contemporary visual arts and media culture? The art of projection has traveled from film exhibition to art installation. With the interdisciplinary approach of visual studies, we examine the history and archaeology of screen media, their cultural and aesthetic dimensions, from pre-cinematic exhibition to the post-medium condition. Considering the art of screening in the deep time of media, we explore the changing architecture of screen space, at the crossroads of science and art, museum and moving images.",162,VES 283,5245
Stranger than Fiction,"Much recent art stages slippages between the fictive and factual. False personas, invented histories, and museums of unnatural history are some such creative deceptions &mdash; so are&nbsp;Punk&rsquo;d,&nbsp;Borat, and more than a few reality TV&nbsp;programs. With a focus on installation art, photography, video, and performance but an eye to popular culture and political scandal as well, this critical studies seminar will trace precedents for treating our sense of reality as a plastic material, and explore the ethical, political, and aesthetic implications. (Note: this is not an art production class).",162,VES 108,5190
The Science of Fiction,"A course in narrative fiction film production, emphasizing experimental and conceptual forms, literary adaptation and artist-filmmakers.

America's $3 Trillion Challenge: Health Care Access and Productivity in the Health Reform Era,"Health care in the United States is often criticized for its expense, ineffectiveness, and inequity. Every policy solution for increasing access to care faces the challenge of dealing with its costs. Because per capita annual health expenditures exceed 8,000 dollars, the subsidies needed to support health insurance expansions are large and controversial. The fundamental challenge to improving health and health care is to rationalize expenditures by improving the efficiency or productivity of care.

Sports and the Law,"The world of sports is one of the most dynamic and complete microcosms of American life. Since the advent of big-money professional and ""amateur"" athletics at the dawn of the 20th century, sports has had to confront a range of important issues revolving around fairness: race, gender, labor versus ownership, drugs, money, violence, and economic freedom. We will address these issues through court cases, articles, and documentary films. Using these sources, students will craft essays that present powerful arguments about the role and place of sports within American life.",54,EXPOS 20.224,10612
Who Owns the Past?,"What does it mean for archaeologists to discover and curate the past? We will consider the rights and problems around the passage of legislation arguing for the return of objects to Native American tribes in the United States. We will grapple with the very mission of archaeology as we study tombstones in Harvard's own backyard, investigating the challenges faced by archaeologists as they collect and interpret often apparently scant, fragile, and historically distant data.

Making the Grade? Middle and High School Math Education in the U.S.,"What are the goals of mathematics education at the middle and high school level, and how do these goals impact our evaluation of the success or failure of math education in America? Why does math education at these levels matter? What societal structures (historic, economic, political, cultural) impact mathematics education? How does math education in turn impact societal structures? As the world changes, how do the goals of mathematics education change, and in what ways? We will explore these issues to become more educated participants in this ongoing discussion.",56,FRSEMR 40P,10836
Money and Other Virtual Realities,"What is money? Its practical importance is plain, but its essence is a mystery. In different places, at different times, it has assumed such wildly varying forms as seashells paper notes, and computer data&mdash;a fact that reminds us that money isn&rsquo;t any fixed, concrete thing, a tangible object in the world, but rather a sort of virtual reality, something whose presence and power depends entirely on human perception. What makes money seem so potent and real? The seminar will bring together exploration of this question with the study of illusionism in two other domains&mdash;cinema and close-up magic. We will not only read about and discuss the theory of how virtual realities like money work, but also pursue practical hands-on exercises in movie-making and the design of mystifying tricks.",56,FRSEMR 31E,10801
Trials from Ancient Athens,"In classical Athens, litigants represented themselves before hundreds of jurors who rendered verdicts without instruction from a judge. Although Athens is often praised for its participatory political institutions, the best-known example of Athenian justice is an embarrassment: the trial and execution of Socrates. Was the Athenian legal system a shining example of the potential of popular, democratic justice, or a cautionary tale suggesting that law is best left to experts? We will evaluate Athens&rsquo; distinctively amateur legal system by reading surviving court speeches involving homicide, assault, adultery, prostitution, slander, treason, citizenship, property and commerce, as well as Plato&rsquo;s account of Socrates&rsquo; defense speech. We will analyze the speeches as pieces of legal rhetoric and for the insight they offer into ancient approaches to crime and punishment, the regulation of sexuality (rape, adultery, prostitution, homosexuality), the trial jury, court procedure, and commercial law. Taught by a law professor, the focus will be on comparing ancient and modern approaches to problems faced by all legal systems. The broader goal will be to explore the role of law in a democratic society. Students will be expected to write one 5-page paper, to contribute to and lead one class discussion, and to participate in a &ldquo;mock trial&rdquo; of an Athenian homicide case.",56,FRSEMR 31P,10803
"The American Death Penalty: Morality, Law, and Politics","This seminar will address the controversies that swirl around the American death penalty in the distinct but related contexts of morality, law, and politics. At the level of moral theory, we will consider whether the death penalty is ever justified as a state practice, both in the abstract and in application, given concerns about its fairness and efficacy in deterring crime. We will explore the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s &ldquo;constitutionalization&rdquo; of capital punishment starting with its landmark decision in 1972 in the case of Furman v. Georgia. We will trace the Court&rsquo;s attempt to deal with issues of fair process, proportionality, cruelty, reliability, and racial discrimination. Close readings of key opinions will show how the Court&rsquo;s interpretation of the majestic generalities of the Constitution&mdash;the guarantees of &ldquo;due process&quot;, &ldquo;equal protection,&rdquo; and protection from &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishments&rdquo;&mdash;have been informed by moral theory. Finally, we will consider the American death penalty in political context, both nationally and internationally. We will assess explanations for the anomaly of American retention of capital punishment, alone among Western democracies. We will consider how moral philosophy and legal regulation have affected the course of the American death penalty in the political sphere and contemplate the legal and political future of the institution. Will (or can) the death penalty be reformed? What are the prospects for nationwide abolition (or large-scale resurgence)? Will (or should) the death penalty&rsquo;s future lie in the hands of the courts or the political branches of government?",56,FRSEMR 41E,10838
Romancing the Kitchen: Food Culture across the Romance Languages,"This course offers a taste (sapore) of the knowledge (sapere) that is found in the language and culture the Romance languages, in particular, French, Italian, Spanish, infused by unique flavors of Portuguese and Catalan as well.

Comparative Historical Mythology,"Deals with an innovative approach to comparative mythology by incorporating an historical approach, not by the commonly assumed archetypes or diffusion. Working backwards from our earliest written sources (Egypt, etc.), successively earlier stages are detected through repeated reconstructions. Recent developments in genetics, archaeology, linguistics support the proposed historical model that tentatively reaches back to the ""African Eve."" Testing the proposal offers a wide scope for students' participation and research in texts and in the sciences. Open to Freshmen only.",56,FRSEMR 36S,13427
American Dreams from Scarface to Easy Rider,"This class familiarizes students with popular films produced during crucial junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and World War II through the Cold War, McCarthy era, and the 1960s. More specifically, we will study how Hollywood's dream factory responded to dramatic challenges that states of crisis and emergency posed to the founding ideals of our democracy. We will look at the wide range of functions that commercial fantasy productions assumed, how they at times legitimated and bolstered the status quo, but at others also interrogated, exposed, and even indicted social inequity. Course films provide a representative sampling of classical American features from 1932 to 1969, including Scarface, It Happened One Night, The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, High Noon, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Manchurian Candidate, and Easy Rider.",57,AESTHINT 57,10852

History of American Democracy,"Today we often hear that American democracy is broken-but what does a healthy democracy look like? How has American democratic governance functioned in the past, and how has it changed over time? This course approaches American history with these questions in mind. Based on the case method, each short reading will introduce students to a different critical episode in the development of American democracy, from drafting of the Constitution to contemporary fights over same-sex marriage.

Models of Conflict in International Relations,"This course is both a simple introduction to game theory, and a literature review of game theoretical approaches to the study of international conflict and war. Game theory is a tool for analyzing strategic interaction between rational actors. The course will feature games like the Prisoners' Dilemma, the Chicken, and models of bargaining. Students will learn how these and related tools can be used to understand and analyze historical and current instances of international conflict. Specifically, we will try to answer questions like: why do states fight costly wars in international relations? Why do peaceful negotiations fail? How does deterrence work? Why do states get into costly arms races? How does domestic politics shape international conflict?",70,GOV 1729,10895
"Media, Public Opinion and Foreign Policy","This course investigates the means through which the media and public opinion influence U.S. foreign policy. We will consider how the public learns about foreign policy, whether and when they care about it, and when political leaders will be responsive to public preferences. We will also consider the effects of real-time global news reporting and media fragmentation. The goal is to understand the interaction between the media, the public and political leaders.",70,GOV 1793,10897
Cryptography,"Cryptography is as old as human communication itself, but has undergone a revolution in the last few decades. It is now about much more than &quot;secret writing&quot; and includes seemingly paradoxical notions such as communicating securely without a shared secret, and computing on encrypted data. In this challenging but rewarding course we will start from the basics of private and public key cryptography and go all the way up to advanced notions such as fully homomorphic encryption and software obfuscation. This is a proof-based course that will be best appreciated by mathematically mature students.",50,COMPSCI 127,10729
Anthropology of Religion,"What happened to religion in the modern world? We start off by exploring traditional anthropological themes, such as animism, magic, and ritual, while paying particular attention to the classic secularization thesis advanced by social scientists. We will then focus on the crucial contemporary issues, such as debates on secularism, globalization and commodification of religion, body and sexuality, secular eschatologies, such as transhumanism, and the emergence of &quot;new age&quot; spirituality. This course is not a survey of specific religions, but a theoretical introduction to the main themes in the anthropological study of religion.",6,ANTHRO 1936,10659
All Physics in 13 Days,"Some claim that there are 13 ideas or principles that can form the bedrock for a pretty good understanding our physical and technological world.

Origins of the Food We Eat,"The most significant lifestyle revolution in the human past was the change from hunting and gathering to agriculture and pastoralism. That shift in the subsistence base has facilitated, and has been facilitated by, increasing populations and a restructuring of social and economic relations over the past 10,000 years. Focusing on key geographic areas and transformative time periods, we discuss how this process began by focusing on the domestication of what have become the staples and major condiments of modern diets around the world. We also consider the spread and adoption of domestic plants and animals across the Eastern and Western Hemispheres as well as the globalization of food that began at the end of the 15th century CE with the Columbian Exchange.To study the processes of domestication and subsequent exploitation of domestic plants and animals requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Thus we sample contributions from a wide range of fields including archaeology, anthropology, history, linguistics, botany, zoology, genetics, biogeochemistry, climatology, geomorphology, oceanography, demography, and nutritional science. Fundamental, however, are archaeological excavations, which provide the material remains necessary for specialized analyses as well as the temporal and social contexts needed for their interpretation.The course is discussion-based, with background material, concepts, and topics introduced by the instructor. Geographical focus is on West, South, and East Asia, Mesoamerica, and the Andean region, with other areas (Europe, Central Asia, Africa, New Guinea, Oceania, Amazonia, and North America) touched upon for specific foods. Readings are in the primary and secondary literature, focusing on key plants, animals, analytical methods, and interpretative debates. Evaluation is based on completing readings and two short written assignments each week and participating in class discussions. Graduate students are required to submit a short tightly focused research paper.",6,ANTHRO 1040,12957

It is open to graduate and advanced undergraduate students working on a senior thesis.",72,HIST 2277,10946
Modern China,"This lecture course will provide a survey of some of the major issues in the history of post-imperial China (1912- ). Beginning with the decline of the Qing and the dramatic collapse of China&rsquo;s imperial system in 1911, the course shall examine how China has sought to redefine itself anew over the past one-hundred years. The revolutionary years of 1911, 1949, and 1978 will serve as our three fulcra, as we investigate how China has tussled with a variety of &lsquo;isms&rsquo; (such as republicanism, militarism, nationalism, socialism, and state capitalism) in its pursuit of an appropriate system of governance and social organization. In so doing, we shall also explore the social, economic, cultural, and scientific changes wrought by these varied attempts at state-building.",72,HIST 1602,10933
Food for Thought: Culinary Culture in Spain and Beyond,"The French have said that the history of a nation depends on what they eat. Yet in the case of Spain, it&rsquo;s clearly the reverse. What Spain has eaten has been a consequence of the country&rsquo;s vast -and often turbulent- history. Invasions, expansions, exile and immigration have created and continue to create the cuisine and culture, which will be our focus in this seminar. Likewise, we will consider Spain&rsquo;s culinary exchange with Latin America, with specific reference to Argentina, Peru and the Caribbean. From don Quijote&rsquo;s rudimentary repas, to Almod&oacute;var&rsquo;s gazpacho, we&rsquo;ll conclude at the tables of the globalized metropolis. We will first consider food and identity, then food, its rituals and traditions. We will examine Spain from the Middle Ages until the present, the history and regions of the peninsula, and the culinary consequences of transatlantic voyages. We will also consider the repercussions of Europeans arriving in the 19th century, and those of the many closer, traumatic events of the 20th century, and beyond. The readings, all in English, are by novelists, historians, chefs, food critics, sociologists, poets, cartoonists and travel writers over the span of ten centuries. The films and videos are more recent, and will have subtitles. No previous knowledge of Spanish language, or travel to any of the countries mentioned, is required. Neither do prospective students need extensive cooking skills. The only pre-requisite is curiosity about what, why, and how the people of Spain and Latin America have eaten throughout their history, and how this reflects identity and culture of these lands.",56,FRSEMR 32M,10805
"Black Holes, String Theory and the Fundamental Laws of Nature","The quest to understand the fundamental laws of nature has been ongoing for centuries. This seminar will assess the current status of this quest. In the first five weeks we will cover the basic pillars of our understanding: Einstein&rsquo;s theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics and the Standard Model of particle physics. We will then examine the inadequacies and inconsistencies in our current picture, including for example the problem of quantum gravity, the lack of a unified theory of forces, Dirac&rsquo;s large numbers problem, the cosmological constant problem, Hawking&rsquo;s black hole information paradox, and the absence of a theory for the origin of the universe. Attempts to address these issues and move beyond our current understanding involve a network of intertwined investigations in string theory, M theory, inflation and non-abelian gauge theories and have drawn inspiration from the study of black holes and developments in modern mathematics. These forays beyond the edge of our current knowledge will be reviewed and assessed. The format of the course will be discussion of weekly reading assignments, and a final paper. Non-scientists are welcome.",56,FRSEMR 21V,10792
Brain Invaders: Building and Breaking Barriers in the Nervous System,"The brain has evolved a unique but very effective system to protect itself from invaders. In this course, we will explore the specific defenses that the nervous system uses to protect itself. We will also examine how some pathogens evade or breach those defenses and the impact of those invasions. Finally, we will explore how scientists have been able to translate their understanding of these pathogenic mechanisms into technologies for research and therapeutic applications.",98,MCB 170,11037
"Revolution and Reform in Britain and France, 1820-1880","The Industrial Revolution transformed social class and caused urban squalor, deep poverty, and unrest. But while France saw three major revolts (1830, 1848, 1871) Britain remained quiet. Why? This course explores that question, using novels by Dickens and Hugo and historical evidence on life in London and Paris. We will also look at contemporary representations of the 19th century, asking what they tell us about modern understandings of class inequality, revolution, and reform.",73,HIST-LIT 90AV,10960
Youth Protest in Europe,"This seminar examines the &quot;spirit of 1968&quot; in Prague, Paris, and Berlin. It examines specific protests in these cities in the context of widespread challenges to state control, capitalism and racism. The seminar show how political critiques were expressed through nonconformity in dress, sexuality, and gender. It explores the anger and passion of &rsquo;68 through an analysis of films, music, manifestos, and memoirs. The course reflects briefly on the legacy of the protest mentality of 1968.",73,HIST-LIT 90AY,10963
Introduction to Social Movements,"Social movements and revolution have long been driving forces behind political, social, and cultural change. From the Civil Rights movement of the 60s to the recent and unpredicted ""Arab Spring,"" the extraordinary mobilization of ordinary people is routinely credited with fundamentally re-shaping societal institutions--the polity, the economy, religion, gender, race, and even the environment. But can we really define and study something as ephemeral as social mobilization? Do we know how social movements begin? Why might they become revolutionary? Can they make a difference in the societies they target? This course examines these questions within the sociological literature on collective action. Theories of social movements and revolutions are then applied to a series of case studies around the globe. Case studies may include the US, Iran, China, El Salvador, Chile, India, Poland, Argentina, Egypt, and Nigeria, among others. Students will also be required to apply course readings to the collective action case of their choosing throughout the semester.",137,SOCIOL 27,11158

Dysfunctional Family as National Allegory in the Middle Eastern Novel,"The radical changes following the emergence of the modern nation state in the Middle East have been most graphically illustrated in the novel. This course examines the trope of the family in flux in narrating the destabilization of traditional social structures, shifting loyalties, and conflicting articulations of identity. The course interrogates the F. Jameson and A. Ahmad debates on `thirdworld' and `national allegory' in reading selected novels of the post WWII period to the present, from Turkey, Iran, Israel, and the Arab World. Authors include Naguib Mahfuz, Mohamed Shukri, Hanan Shaykh, Sahar Khalifa, Amos Oz, Elif Shafak, and Mahmoud Dowlatabadi.",24,COMPLIT 255,10677
Social Change in Modern Korea,"This course explores the incredible transformation of Korean society in the modern period. We begin with the demise of the Choso/a7n Dynasty at the end of the 19th century before covering the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), the emergence of two Korean nation-states (1945-1948), the Korean War (1950-53), and the contemporary period (1960-present). The course is divided into two distinct parts. In the first part of the course we discuss Korea's political and economic transformation and in the second, we cover social and cultural change. Upon completion of the course, students should have a thorough grasp of the vast social changes Korea underwent in the 20th century.",137,SOCIOL 181,11169
Democracy and Social Movements in East Asia,"Social movements are an important part of both democratic and non-democratic societies. This course assesses the state of civil society in East Asia by surveying contemporary social movements in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. We start the course by discussing the main concepts and analytic approaches in social movement theory. We then apply these theoretical frameworks to specific mobilization efforts in East Asia, keeping in mind each country's unique historical context. With the theoretical and empirical tools gleaned from the lectures and readings, students will pursue a case analysis of an East Asian social movement of their choosing.",137,SOCIOL 189,11170

From Plantations to Prisons,"From Plantations to Prisons serves as an introduction to the current crisis of mass incarceration. Specifically, it focuses on the religio-historical roots of the U.S. penal industry, suggesting a continuum between plantations and prisons that calls into question our basic notions of justice. The course draws from academic, media, and narrative sources to give particular attention to factors long associated with crime and punishment, such as sin, race, and citizenship. We will also study the unprecedented prison-population explosion (in terms of race, gender and class), and its relationship to major social problems in American cities. Questions for consideration: How do we understand punishment? What is the relationship between race and crime? How are human rights, democracy, and family at risk? An optional visit to at least one Massachusetts state jail/prison will be incorporated into the curriculum.",137,SOCIOL 119,11166

Case Studies in the Medical Humanities: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Experience of Illness,"Disease and healing pose pragmatic and moral challenges for individuals and societies. Artists and writers have struggled to make sense of these tragic and transcendent experiences through fiction, poetry, art, and music. Scholars can explore these archives of the illness experience to understand not just disease and medicine but also what it means to be human. This interdisciplinary course examines how the medical humanities can change how we think about suffering, resilience, and care-giving, an endeavor relevant to anyone who expects to encounter these problems in life (i.e., everyone). In 2015 the course will focus on epidemics; case studies may include plague, tuberculosis, cancer, AIDS, SARS, and Ebola. Future offerings might address chronic disease, mental illness, death and dying, or caregiving.",58,CULTBLF 58,10854
LGBT Literature,"This course examines a range of works from the British and American LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) canon. Our starting premise will be that LGBT themes have been central, rather than peripheral, to the Western literary tradition. We&#39;ll pay close attention to how sexual identity, gender identity, sex, and desire are understood and represented in different social and historical circumstances, as well as the aesthetic traditions and personal experiences shaping these individual works.

Arts of South and Southeast Asia,"This is an introduction to the arts of South and Southeast Asia from the second millennium BCE to the present. Each lecture will examine selective artifacts and sites to understand the history of major artistic traditions developed in response to cultural exchanges and political dynamics within and beyond the region. By examining a wide range of material, such as Buddhist sculptures, Hindu temples, Jain manuscript paintings, Islamic tombs, calendar art, and so on, with fundamental art historical questions, we will consider what makes the arts of South and Southeast Asia unique as well as universal in the twenty-first century context.",75,HAA 18S,10968
South Asian Temple: Theory and Practice,"The main mode of production in Indian temple architecture is often explained through a strict diagram or vastupurusamandala, an idea extracted from Sanskrit artistic treaties (silpasastra or vastusastra) of varying dates. Going beyond this essentialist tendency, the seminar will explore design strategies adopted to create the most powerful sacred space for each religious and political community and examine the historical relationship between the circulation of such architectural (and artistic) knowledge and the production and use of an actual temple. In particular, we will explore the relationship between the architectural representation (as in architectural motif in sculpture and painting) and the architecture as built environment. &nbsp;The regional focus for this semester will be on Deccan (i.e., cave temples). &nbsp;While some prior knowledge of South and Southeast Asian art, history, or religion may be helpful, none is required for the successful completion of this course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",75,HAA 285M,10986

Frameworks: The Art of Looking,"Visual information today is superabundant thanks to our smartphones, tablets, and other screen-based gadgets. But few of us recognize how thoroughly our habits and experiences of looking have been conditioned by interfaces with long and complex histories. Participants in this course, developed as part of the Humanities Project at Harvard, will approach looking through a consideration of key technologies from its history, such as the telescope, the cinema, and the easel painting. Students will learn about the hidden intricacies of looking and hone skills of visual, material, and spatial analysis through encounters with aesthetic objects from Harvard&#39;s collections.",479,HUMAN 11A,11007
Frameworks: The Art of Listening,"Our world is steeped in sound, but we must learn to pay attention to listening. Sounds produce emotions, mark out spaces, call up memories; silence can be deafening; voice is a marker of identity. This course will sharpen our ears. We explore the sonic world through diverse readings and creative projects with sound. Discussions and assignments will open our minds (and ears) to listening practices, what the arts teach us about listening, and how we describe our experiences as listeners. We examine the relationships between sound and time, community, responsibility and attentiveness, and explore the soundscape in which we live.",479,HUMAN 11B,11008
Frameworks: The Art of Reading,"This course introduces ""reading"" as a wide-ranging practice of interpretation, applicable to social phenomena and historical narratives as well as to literary texts. Participants in this introduction to the humanities will examine a range of texts, from poems and political journalism to graphic novels and blogs, both to practice close and subtle reading and to see how these texts seek to establish rules for their own interpretation. Rather than look at a particular artistic tradition or literary history, we will develop a set of ""all-terrain"" interpretive skills that can be deployed on a range of intellectual and cultural objects.",479,HUMAN 11C,11009

Psychology of Language,"How do children manage to learn the sounds, the words and the grammar of their native language in three years or less? Does the language that we speak change how we think? What happens in the mind (and brain) that allows us to convert sound into meaning during language comprehension (and meaning into motor movements during language production)? Why are human languages similar to each other in some ways, and what allows them to vary in others? We will explore these questions integrating the perspectives of linguistics, psychology and cognitive neuroscience.",124,PSY 1605,11096

What Disease Teaches about Cognition,"Seeks to reconcile the complicated and messy problems of patients with brain disease with the concise analysis of precisely defined cognitive functions in normal subjects. Students will learn to overlap cognitive functions on to the brain in disease - at the gross dissection and imaging levels - and to understand some of the complex interactions of individual cognitive operations in disease. Includes dissection of a human brain, mapping on to imaging, dissection of multi-dimensional clinical disorders into their component functional parts.",97,MBB 980H,11034
The Origins and Evolution of Cognition: A Comparative Study of Human and Nonhuman Abilities,"Most scientists agree cognition is widespread in nature and involves an organism processing information to solve problems (like avoiding predators, finding prey, attracting a mate, achieving shelter), and in humans higher-level reasoning and conceptualizing. Less clear are the origins and evolutionary basis of cognition-what evolutionary pressures were exerted that selected for such processing? Explores possible ways to answer this question with research in anthropology, neurobiology, philosophy, psychology, genetics, sociality, and other disciplines. Faculty from a variety of departments attend discussions in their areas of expertise and assist students in coming to their own conclusions.",97,MBB 980G,11033

"Technology, Environment, and Society","Our interactions with the natural world are increasingly mediated through changes in technology. Technologies create risks, generate solutions, reshape the environment, and alter our perception of the boundaries between nature and artifice. This course draws on major theories of technology and society to inform and deepen our understanding of environmental problems and policy options.",53,ESPP 77,10786
Himalayan Art,"Understood as a divine abode in Indic mythology and envisioned as the immortal realm of ""Shangri-la"" by later western interpreters, the Himalayas abound with Hindu and Buddhist holy sites. This course explores the vibrant visual culture of the Himalayan region. Two learning goals are: 1) Understanding the historical development of distinctive artistic forms in paintings and sculptures of Nepal and Tibet during major moments of artistic innovations in the region, including the artistic responses to the current political situation; 2) Locating this knowledge in the context of the history of reception and collecting of Himalayan art in the west.",75,HAA 183K,10982
Adam & Eve,"What is the power of a story? For several thousand years Adam and Eve were the protagonists in the central origin myth of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim worlds. That myth was the arena for ethical reasoning about transgression and innocence, sexuality, gender roles, labor, suffering, and death. Jointly taught by History of Art and Architecture and English, our course focuses on this enigmatic story and its spectacular elaborations in theology, philosophy, literature and art. Above all, looking closely at some of the greatest achievements of European art and literature- from Durer, Michelangelo and Rembrandt to Milton's Paradise Lost- we will compare the possibilities of the verbal and visual arts in portraying human being.",60,ETHRSON 37,10969
Existential - Phenomenological Anthropology,"The aim of this seminar course is to familiarize students with some of the topics, themes and methods associated with existential phenomenological thought, and to explore ways in which this tradition may prove useful to students in their own research and writing. Key concepts include intentionality and temporality, the epoch&eacute;, the body-subject, praktognosis, flow experience, life world, intersubjectivity, the illusio, being-in-the world (Dasein), narrativity, space and place, language and experience, the emotions and the imagination.",160,RELIGION 1915,11255
The Politics of Storytelling,"This course addresses Hannah Arendt's thesis that storytelling is a critical strategy for bridging the gap between private and public realms. Storytelling is thus understood as a mode of social and political activity that involves a struggle between personal and collective representations of the ""truth"" and between unofficial and official versions of events. Through the close analysis of storytelling in a variety of situations, we will explore the ways in which the meaning of stories resides not in any ahistorical essence or internal logic, but emerges from the everyday human struggle to strike a balance between domains of experience that are, on the one hand, felt to belong to oneself or one's own kind, and, on the other, felt to be shared by or to belong to others.",160,RELIGION 1920,11256
What is the History of Medicine?,"The emergence of the science of medicine and its professionalization have been integral aspects of human history. The history of medicine allows us to trace the various traditions that have come together to create ""modern medicine."" In this section, students will examine the human endeavor to be healthy and to cure disease. The practice of medicine draws on changing ideas about the natural world and the body. It also demands interventions in the physical environment so as to maximize public health, and readily incorporates transformative technologies from other sectors of human society. Students will be asked to reflect on the interaction of medicine and culture through questions such as: How did western powers use biomedicine in the context of empire? How do non-western cultures appropriate and indigenize biomedicine?",72,HIST 97A,10917
What is Intellectual History?,"Intellectual historians study almost every period, place, and theme in human history: from classical times to the present, from Asia to the Americas, by examining philosophy and religion, social and political thought, literature and art, and other expressions of human agency and intention that range from ancient epics to graphic novels. This section will draw examples from a wide range of moments and regions to ask how intellectual history has developed as a field, what methods it uses, and how it can be distinguished from other forms of history even as it informs debates of interest to all historians.",72,HIST 97B,10918
What is the History of History?,"Everything has a history, and the discipline of history has a particularly long and broad one. In this section we'll focus on ideas about how and why to study history and on the practices of historical research and writing as they have varied across different cultural contexts. In selected case studies we will consider who wrote and who read history, and how historians answered questions that we also ask ourselves today. E.g. What features are essential to a good historical account? Does the study of history teach moral lessons? How does history interact with memory?",72,HIST 97C,10919
What is Environmental History?,"This section gives new History concentrators an introduction to environmental history. Most historians leave the natural world out of the story, but environmental historians regard nature as the inescapable context for human history, including the human impact on nature. We will explore how the histories of the environment and of humans can (and perhaps should) be written together. Is there a ""natural archive"" which historians can consult in parallel with conventional libraries and archives? Do places have ""biographies,"" just as people do? Can natural entities (mountains, dogs, rivers, microbes, climate) have ""agency"" in the same way human actors can?",72,HIST 97D,10920
What is Material History?,"This section offers new History concentrators an overview of the history and anthropology of material culture. Our coverage will range widely across both time and space; major themes will include things created in the deep human past as well as the habits of consumption and even addiction that define our relationship with things in the present day. Do we own things? Or do things own us? Does having more stuff necessarily lead to happiness? Readings will offer students a chance to work not just with history and historical sources, but also art history, literary studies, archaeology, environmental history, and cognitive neuroscience.",72,HIST 97F,10922

The Call of Beauty,"Across the centuries, philosophers, poets, scientists, and mathematicians have meditated on the nature and power of beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have said beauty calls on us to educate ourselves; others have said it is a call to repair the injuries of the world. Our readings will come from both men and women: Plato and Sappho in ancient Greece; Aquinas and Lady Murasaki in the medieval period; Rilke and Maya Lin today.&nbsp; We will study features associated with beauty such as color (e.g. &ldquo;The Lady and the Unicorn&rdquo; tapestries depicting the five senses) and symmetry (e.g. Augustine&rsquo;s De Musica; a book on symmetry by astrophysicist Mario Livio; a recorded debate among physicists about math and beauty).&nbsp; Does the call of beauty change according to its location? Among the sites we will contemplate are the beauty of earth (e.g. the writings of environmentalist Rachel Carson; the ephemeral sculptures of Andy Goldsworthy) and the beauty of faces (such as Homer on Helen, Seamus Heaney on an unnamed soldier).",56,FRSEMR 39N,10828
"Humans, Technology, and Biopolitics","Recent scientific and technological advances are increasingly questioning what it means to be human. Debates on life extension, gene editing, and artificial intelligence regularly appear in the media, with views ranging from techno-optimism&mdash;the idea that such breakthroughs will deliver us from suffering&mdash;to the warnings that technoscience is advancing at such a rapid pace, that there is not enough time for ethical guidelines to be developed. Some argue that science is increasingly delivering on the promises traditionally made by Judeo-Christian religions, while others assert that such techno-optimist thinking is a kind of new religion in and of itself. Debates around emerging technologies cut across traditional political lines, making them specifically biopolitical, where such issues as human enhancement, control of reproduction,&nbsp; genetic engineering, and many others, create new types of political positions and actors. This course will examine these issues, focusing specifically on what concepts of &ldquo;the human&rdquo; emerge from these debates, and how certain ideas about the future affect how we live and manage our time now, as futurist discourses are producing affective states of both hope and fear. Among the case studies for this course, we will look at the cultural and philosophical movements of transhumanism and posthumanism, new utopian and eschatological imaginaries, as well as ethical and legal questions of developing and using biomedical technologies, including their non-therapeutic use. As we proceed, we will pay particular attention to the shifting relations between body and person, human and time, transcendence and corporality, and technology and biology, while discussing how they contribute to the rethinking of the human condition in the technological age. Materials for the course will include academic pieces from a range of disciplines: STS, anthropology, philosophy, bioethics, as well as non-academic media sources, documentaries, and science fiction films.",136,SOC-STD 98OC,11154

Ancient Lives,"What are the essential elements of human society? Have our fundamental conditions developed, and how? Can we use themes from ancient history to think about contemporary society and culture? These questions are in focus in this course on 'Ancient Lives', which explores the earliest human civilizations in the region commonly known as Mesopotamia (c. 3000-300 bce) in what is now Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Few elements in the way we live and organize ourselves today are to be taken for granted. There is, and has always been, a wealth of ways in which humans live. But biologically we are the same as our ancestors of 5000 years ago, at the dawn of history. Any likeness or difference between 'us and them' is therefore likely to be a product of history and culture. 'Ancient Lives' builds upon this realization to inspire a critical way of thinking about society in the broadest possible scope. Areas explored during the course are selected for their relevance across the range of contemporary life - they include freedom, music, public health, food, jurisprudence, trade, the visual arts, science, sexuality, religion and political power. You learn about how societies and individuals have dealt with change on multiple levels, from large-scale societal revolutions to personal transformation. Having taken this course, you will have gained a fundamental understanding and appreciation of human life in the broadest scope, as well as of your own life as a part of history. You will be able to critically assess contemporary discourses on the study of 'the other' in past and present; engage with core concepts of human society, such as justice, beauty, value and belief on a broad historical base; be familiar with examples of classical social theory and thinkers through concrete cases in which their work has been applied to or shaped by the study of the past; and acquire skills in presenting scholarly work to a general audience.",101,ANE 103,11046
"Mommy Wars: Race, Class, and the Politics of Motherhood","The term ""mommy wars"" emerged in 1990 to suggest that relations between ""working mothers"" and ""stay at home mothers"" were characterized by mutual animosity and petty status battles between women defined through their roles as mothers. Yet the political, cultural, and economic struggles over motherhood have deep roots and high stakes. This seminar will look critically at the history and literature of the ""mommy wars,"" from The Feminine Mystique to contemporary advice literature, paying special attention to voices often excluded from mainstream media representations.

Clinical Psychology in Everyday Life,"The goal of this course is to give you exposure to the types of evidence-based psychological interventions available for many clinical and non-clinical conditions, such as sadness, anxiety, substance use, insomnia, pain, and arguments with your significant other. While this seminar emphasizes intervention research in the context of children and adolescents, the principles are often applicable across age groups.Through this seminar, you will learn to notice and apply principles of psychological intervention to the world around you, not only in theory but also in practice. The seminar is not a self-help program or a training program for providing therapeutic services to others. Instead, the weekly discussions, exercises, and assignments will help you view the world through the lens of a scientist-practitioner &ndash; and apply those insights to everyday life in a scientific manner.",124,PSY 1852,11381

Psychology of Women,"How does being a woman affect our behavior, our evaluations of ourselves, and our interactions with others? This course examines psychological science on women and girls in western industrialized societies, addressing such topics as gender stereotypes, girlhood, women and work, relationships, pregnancy and motherhood, mental health, violence against women, and women in later adulthood. We will consider these topics through an understanding of gender as a social construction, being mindful of the intersections of gender, sexuality, class, and race. Although focused on women&rsquo;s lives and experiences, this course is highly relevant to people of all genders.",124,PSY 1009,11379

Legal Thought Now: Law and the Structure of Society,"Law is the institutional form of the life of a people. It embodies the formative institutions and assumptions of society. But law is never a closed system: we can enlist its disharmonies in the service of reimagination and reform.This course considers the character and consequences of a practice of legal analysis, couched in the language of purpose, policy, and principle, that has become dominant in the United States and in much of the world. It asks how we might change this practice to make it both more realistic about established law and more useful to the development of alternative futures for society. It provides an introduction to jurisprudence from the standpoint of an interest in transformation.",70,GOV 1096,11360

Small Molecules and Biological Processes,"Small molecules are extraordinarily useful tools to investigate biological processes, perturb cell states and treat human diseases. They are complementary to many biological techniques (e.g. expression of mutant proteins, RNAi, genome editing and antibodies) in that they are fast-acting, typically cell permeable, easily reversible, and they can engage multiple targets simultaneously. In this course, we will discuss how these useful small molecules are discovered, how they have revealed deep insights into biological processes, and how they are employed as therapeutics.",21,CHEM 110,11342

Paradox in Public Health,"What are the goals of public health interventions? What should they be? If public health as practiced today is often concerned with empowering individuals to make their own health choices, then what happens when the health interests of the population conflict with the interests and rights of the individual? In this class, we will use scientific articles and other academic sources to consider potential paradoxes of public health, both historical and contemporary.",54,EXPOS 20.243,11355
American Revelations,"This course considers a number of key historical episodes in which American religious figures claimed to receive divine revelation. From the ad hoc prophets (such as Anne Hutchinson and Tenskwatawa) to the scripture writers (such as Joseph Smith and Ellen White), from the African American organizers (including Nat Turner and Father Divine) to the advocates of natural revelation (including Theodore Parker and Margaret Fuller), this course examines the contexts, contents and implications of the claim that God still speaks to Americans. Drawing from such scholars as T.M. Luhrmann, Ann Taves, Leigh Schmidt and Rodney Stark, we read anthropological, sociological and&mdash;especially&mdash;historical efforts to understand what it has meant when an American declares she has had a revelation. Students will then try their hand at constructing an account of a revelatory episode of their choice in American history.",160,RELIGION 2562,11411
Tectonics Lab: Conference Course,"Tectonics Lab (formerly &ldquo;Construction Lab&rdquo;) introduces students to material properties, structural behavior, and fabrication-and-assembly issues in architecture through a combination of lectures, workshops, and design-build projects.&nbsp; The course emphasizes two modes of architectural experimentation: analytical and intuitive.&nbsp; Abstract and architectonic exercises involving these modes of experimentation will take place in a workshop format, with students working in teams of varying sizes.&nbsp; Weekly lectures provide a theoretical basis for the design-build projects, with topics including fundamental, non-quantitative statics (e.g., free-body diagrams, types of forces and reactions) and generic structural approaches; material properties and fabrication; joinery and assembly; scalar transformation; modular construction; kinetic structures; and more.&nbsp; Design-build projects challenge students to engage lecture material in a hands-on manner; these projects focus on the construction of full-scale artifacts that may be tested against a range of performance criteria.&nbsp; In each project, students will explore the role of material expression, figuration, and formal gesture in communicating their ideas.&nbsp; Project documentation through drawing, photography, and video is an essential component of coursework, and a comprehensive course portfolio will be due at the end of term.The principal objective of Tectonics Lab is to extend our shared knowledge of material properties, structural behavior, and construction techniques by testing new ideas.&nbsp; Our research model is a hybrid: equal parts scientific laboratory (where narrowly defined hypotheses are tested and evaluated) and artist&rsquo;s atelier (where expression of ideas, both articulated and ineffable, is the goal).&nbsp;",75,HAA 179X,11412

How Sweet is it to be Loved By You: Black Love and the Emotional Politics of Respect,"The word `Love' is almost never used in any portrayal or description of the African American community's daily life in contemporary media and in the social sciences. But in fact, Love, in all its many forms, familial, erotic, romantic, fraternal, is abundant, sometimes dominant, in Black culture: song, film, literature. This course will review and analyze the social science literature on intersubjectivity, family, language and ritual and closely read, watch and listen to some of the many Black artists who have looked deeply at this thing called Love.",1,AFRAMER 134X,11433
The Psychology of Left and Right,"What are the origins of the culture war between the political Left and Right? How do psychobiology, upbringing, temperament and moral values shape this difference in political orientations? In this course, we will explore the psychological factors underlying political divisions as well as the role of our social networks and desire for group identity in maintaining and widening the divide. The goal of this course is to develop your empirical, theoretical and methodological understandings of psychological research underlying the Left-Right conflict while providing you with tools to detect partisanship and to promote the cooperation and connection necessary for a well-functioning democracy.",124,PSY 1558,11440
Character of God in Early America,"From the arbitrary sovereign of the Calvinists to the feminized Lord of the Moravians to the predictable creator of the Deists, perceptions of God ran the spectrum in early America. Many of the key debates of the period&mdash;about science and slavery, monarchy and poverty, scripture and disestablishment&mdash;fell back on assumptions about the character of Deity. This course examines the most prominent positions on the divine character and considers the ways they shaped the cultural developments of the period. As the culminating experience of the course, students write a substantial paper that seeks to draw a portrait of divinity from a prominent cultural artifact of the period, such as the abolitionist newspaper The Liberator, the Declaration of Independence, or the novels of Nathaniel Hawthorne",160,RELIGION 2500,11448
Biology of Symbiosis: Living Together Can Be Fun!,"This course examines the remarkable diversity of symbiotic associations on Earth, their ecology and evolution, and their roles in human health and disease, agriculture, and biotechnology. Symbioses - ""living together"" - with microbes are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from lichens to the human microbiome. Symbiosis drives evolution, resulting in ""new organisms"" and charges us to think about biodiversity on a new level. In this freshman seminar, microbial symbioses with animals (including humans), plants, fungi, protists will be discussed, complemented by microscopy and field trips to local environs including Boston Harbor Islands, the New England Aquarium, and your own microbiome.",56,FRSEMR 24Q,11445

Democracy in the Digital Age,"Information technology has transformed politics with breathtaking speed. But have these changes been as important, and as positive, as is widely claimed? In this course, we assess technology's alleged role in destabilizing autocratic regimes, look at technology's impact on American politics, and assess whether we should reform our political institutions to make greater use of new technologies. We consult studies by social scientists, read the Twitter feed of the Syrian opposition, watch a documentary about the protestors in Tahrir Square, analyze the rise of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, study a short story by Isaac Asimov, and debate ""The Dictator's Practical Internet Guide to Power Retention.""",54,EXPOS 20.245,11480
American Criminals,"The United States is a country fascinated with crime stories. But why do crime novels attract us? What do they reveal about where we come from, what we believe in, and who we are? This course will explore these and other related questions by studying fictional and nonfictional accounts of crimes committed in the United States by its citizens. In our third unit, students will research a crime that occurred in their hometown, and think about how that crime might have been shaped by the town's specific culture. Here students will draw on theoretical discussions about culture and criminality and uncover materials from the public record.",54,EXPOS 20.247,11482
Connections - Studio II,"Architecture, as an act of design, is about placing objects the world. But architecture also fundamentally asks us to continuously engage with, and re-conceptualize, the world for which we are designing. As such, architecture as a discipline requires us to challenge our own positionality with regards to the world we all occupy.This studio takes on the challenge through a series of design exercises focused on understanding, engaging with, and reimaging the urban condition. In this course, we will be mobilizing the autonomous architectural transformations mastered in HAA 96A to intervene with a programed architectural project designed for a specific site in Harvard Square. Students will produce projects that address existing site conditions, and will develop designs in response to a determined program. Students will be expected to take into account projected occupants and other users of the site. Throughout the course, we will approach architectural design as both a method of producing urban environments, and also as an avenue through which to understand our cities. We will be directly confronting the social, environmental, and cultural contexts that are necessarily implicated in any design process.The studio centers on three progressive design assignments, culminating in an architectural project for a site in Harvard Square.&nbsp; Design exercises will be supplemented with a series of short readings. Technical workshops will allow students to further develop skills in mapping, rendering, and simple animation.",75,HAA 96B,11490
"Growth, Technology, Inequality, and Evolution","An economist and a humanist, together with professors from the natural sciences, analyze familiar conceptual and policy-relevant issues from viewpoints of their respective disciplines. For example, how do we measure inequality, and at what point does it become problematic (and how do we know)? How then should it be addressed (e.g., tax code, minimum wage)? What are the best policies to confront job losses from technology? What does sustainable growth mean? The goal is not merely to examine four intertwined issues ""growth, technology, inequality, and evolution"" but also to understand the distinct concerns and methods of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.",45,ECON 1000A,13943
Wizards and Wild Things,"This course will consider the origin and evolution of children's literature by examining pivotal works from the Puritan era to the present. We'll also draw on critical perspectives as we consider evolving ideas of childhood, persistent disputes about what children should read, and the essential function of imaginative literature for children. In the final unit, students will conduct research to place a major children's author of their choice in a relevant cultural and historical context.",54,EXPOS 20.250,11500
"The Toll of Infection: Understanding Disease in Scientific, Social, and Cultural Contexts","This course will review the devastating impact of infectious diseases on wars, politics, economics, religion, public health, and society as reflected in history, literature, and the arts. We will study how infections spawned revolutionary epidemiologic and scientific advances in detection, treatment, and prevention. We will address the gaps between discovery and implementation, including ethical, social, economic, and health systems barriers to progress. The disparate impact of infections on underserved and minority populations, and approaches to addressing such injustice, will be emphasized. We will confront challenges posed by microbial mutation (e.g., antibiotic resistance, evasion of immunity, and adaptation of animal viruses to humans).&nbsp; By weaving together knowledge from science and the humanities, students will understand the historical and contemporary impact of infections and potential solutions to the challenges they pose.",61,SCILIVSY 26,12392

We explore how medical syndromes provide insights into biological processes and how biological mechanisms underlie human disease and physiology. Topics range from DNA repair, protein folding and vesicle transport to metabolism, cell migration and cancer. Lectures focus on the experimental evidence for key concepts, and the weekly sections combine a discovery-based laboratory research project with discussions that emphasize problem solving and primary literature.",98,MCB 60,12522
Death and Immortality,"In this course, we will discuss philosophical questions about death and immortality. What is death? Is there a moral difference between ""brain death"" and the irreversible loss of consciousness? Is the classification of a person as dead a moral judgment, or is it an entirely scientific matter? Is death a misfortune to the person who dies? How can death be a misfortune if you are no longer around to experience that misfortune? Is it possible to survive after death? What does it mean for you to survive after your death? Is there such a thing as an immaterial soul distinct from your body? Is immortality something you should want in the first place? Even if you do not live forever, is it nevertheless important that humanity continues to exist after your death? By discussing these questions about death, we will hopefully gain insight about the importance and meaning of life.",56,FRSEMR 30Q,12359
Free Speech,"In this age of rapid globalization and heightened cross-cultural contacts, nations struggle to reaffirm their identities and values. In the United States, one of the most precious values is free speech, embedded in the First Amendment to the Constitution and regarded as a keystone of American democracy. But arguments over the boundaries of free speech have become intense, especially in the era of electronic communication. This seminar will examine the dialogue taking place within the United States and around the world on free speech issues &ndash; sometimes civil, but often a political or cultural confrontation that turns violent. We will discuss international and domestic protests over politically sensitive cartoons, controversies over Holocaust denial, whether hate speech should be banned on campuses, whether the domestic media can ever be legitimately constrained on national security grounds, whether anti-gay religious activists have a right to disrupt military funerals, whether pornography and violent music lyrics should be regulated, and what constitutes free speech on the Internet or cell phones. Through Supreme Court decisions and by other means, we will examine the debate over what it means to be patriotic and whether patriotism requires Americans to say, or prohibits them from saying, certain things &ndash; and examine how standards have changed over the years. We will ask whether other countries&#39; attitudes toward free speech and the other First Amendment freedoms should influence US foreign policy toward those countries. Examples of constraints on free speech in our daily lives and work, unwitting or not, will also be considered.",56,FRSEMR 40L,12377

What is Legal History?,"Legal history has become a popular pursuit in recent decades, but what does it mean to do legal history? Do lawyers, who routinely review precedent or study the evolution of specific pieces of legislation, do legal history? Do judges, when they reconstruct past events in order to apply the law? Do historians, who use legal documentation? And how is legal history differently done in Europe and in the USA? This section will consider these questions (and others) by analyzing the various ways by which different scholars have approached the relationship between law and history over time, in different locations, and for different ends.",72,HIST 97G,12427
What is Urban History?,"This section will explore the methods historians have used to understand the political, economic, and social development of cities and urban life over the past four centuries. How have historians approached the study of metropolitan regions and their inhabitants? What methods have they used to examine the ways in which social and spatial forms differ by time and place? How does urban history provide a unique vantage to analyze issues of class, ethnicity, migration, race, and gender? Readings and discussions will give special attention to cities and transformations in the United States, but we will draw comparative examples from the histories of urban centers across the globe.",72,HIST 97H,12428
What is Biography?,"Biographers write histories of lives. Their storytelling is often novelistic but their standards of evidence are those of the historian. They confront distinctive questions: What lives are worth writing? What is the relationship between the individual and society? What rules govern the relationship between biographers and their subjects? How has the art of biography changed over the centuries, and what forces have driven those changes? In this section, we'll read both notable biographies and the critical literature on biography as a genre that is often seen to be at odds with the conventions of other kinds of historical writing.",72,HIST 97I,12429
Byzantine Imperialism,"The Byzantine Empire is perhaps best known today as the medieval successor to imperial Rome and as a model for later empires in the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. The course investigates imperialism both as an idea and as a practice in Byzantium. We will focus on a variety of themes, such as the role of Constantinople, the methods of governance, the role of coercive and soft power, the integration of diverse communities, the views of empire among the inhabitants of the capital, provincials, and frontiersmen. Primary sources and important secondary works will enable us to examine the specificity of Byzantine imperialism and gain deeper insight into empire as a historical phenomenon.",72,HIST 1935,12439
Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine,"The course integrates an introduction to the structure of macromolecules and a biochemical approach to cellular function. Topics addressing protein function will include enzyme kinetics, the characterization of major metabolic pathways and their interconnection into tightly regulated networks, and the manipulation of enzymes and pathways with mutations or drugs. An exploration of simple cells (red blood cells) to more complex tissues (muscle and liver) is used as a framework to discuss the progression in metabolic complexity. Students will also develop problem solving and analytical skills that are more generally applicable to the life sciences.",98,MCB 63,12523
The Cell Biology of Human Life in the World,"This course teaches fundamental concepts in cell biology in the context of individual life histories drawn from different parts of the world. Each life case focuses on key aspects of human development, growth, aging and disease while providing a nuanced view of the interplay between the life sciences, geography and culture. For example, a comparative discussion of aging in the United States and Japan is used to explore diet, cellular metabolism and its relationship to protein damage and turnover, while the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and AIDS in South Asia is used to explore mucosal immunity and the basis for estimating relative infection risk. Each case delves into the cell biology of major biological events across the life history of the human",98,MCB 64,12524
The Meaning of Life,"Is there a point to life as a whole? That is the question about the ""meaning of life,"" a question that is notoriously hard to make precise but has animated much literature, art and philosophy. Philosophers have provided both very disheartening answers and more uplifting ones. Serious scrutiny of such answers should be of interest to anybody who wishes to make reflection on her/his life as a whole part of her/his education. This class is wide-ranging, but its main focus is on contributions by relatively recent thinkers in the Anglo-American analytical tradition of philosophy.",60,ETHRSON 38,12390

The Rise of Pop,"The idea that there is a hierarchy separating high and low art extends as far back as Aristotle, but during the past fifty years American culture has depended upon destroying this hierarchy. This course examines what happens to art and society when the boundaries separating high and low art are gone. We will examine Thomas Pynchon, Andy Warhol, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show along with cultural theorists such as Adorno, Benjamin, Sontag, and Bakhtin.",54,EXPOS 20.251,12319
The Science of Emotion,"Reason has been routinely championed as the epitome of human achievement and framed as profoundly at odds with emotion. For much of the 20th century, scientists had even characterized emotion as unimportant. However, after the past 30 years of research, we now understand emotion to be a crucial factor in human behavior, including reasoning. This class will focus on the science of emotion. We'll read theoretical and empirical pieces from psychology and neuroscience to explore what defines emotion, how it operates, and how it allows for the individuality and universality of human experience.",54,EXPOS 20.256,12324
East Asian Cinema,"This course introduces major works, genres, and waves of East Asian cinema from the silent era to the present, including films from Mainland China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. We will discuss issues ranging from formal aesthetics to historical representation, from local film industries to transnational audience reception.

Media Cultures in the People's Republic,"This seminar examines the changing Chinese mediascape from the 1950s to the present. Every week, we will focus a different form of representational media, from propaganda posters, photography, radio broadcasting, and cinema, to television, video piracy, and the Internet. We will ask question such as: How have media technologies changed contemporary Chinese culture and society? Were they instruments of totalitarian control, commodities of market capitalism, or tools of resistance and independent expression? How did the mass media affect perception, experiences, and memories of socialism and postsocialism, as well as the periods' cultural forms and aesthetics? What is specific or special about each medium, and how do different types of media interact in the Chinese context? While analyzing media texts, we will also consider their sociopolitical, institutional, and technological as well as engage with media theories and explore untapped historical sources.",32,EAFM 222,12262

The first series of lectures covers basic regression techniques for categorical data (ordinal and multinomial logit models) as well as advanced techniques such as causal models (propensity score matching), spatial regression, censored regression (tobit), nonlinear regression (generalized additive models), regularization and shrinkage methods (Ridge, LASSO), and generalized estimation equation (GEE) for longitudinal/correlational data. Another lecture series deals with clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, BIRCH, and mixture models (e.g. latent class analysis). The mixture model approach will then be embedded into a regression context in order to estimate regression models with unobserved heterogeneity (latent class regression). Finally, there will be a unit on functional data analysis (FDA) where each single observation is described by a function (e.g. eye tracking data, brain imaging data).",124,PSY 3450,12598

Through the systematic comparison of several cases, the course discusses how ideas of race and nation have interacted in Latin America, shaping opportunities for mobilization and public policies; how racial identities have been formed and invoked for different cultural and political purposes; and how ideas of race and ethnicity have contributed to the stratification of Latin American societies, which are among the most unequal in the world. A final section looks at the creation of transnational networks of cooperation by indigenous and black activists and how their exchanges have shaped ideas of race and forms of mobilization in their respective societies. Students in this class will have the opportunity to meet with the authors of some of the works we are reading.",1,AFRAMER 219,12212

We trace the formation of these ideas in the North Atlantic, their diffusion to various areas of the world, and the manner in which cultural and political elites adopted or challenged them. We will devote considerable time to the emergence of eugenics, the science of racial improvement, in Europe, the Americas, and Africa and study the process of institutionalization of this science in Nazi Germany and elsewhere, including the United States. A final section of the course discusses the impact of contemporary science on ideas of race. Students in this class will work with texts and archival materials related to these scientists, some of whom were Harvard faculty.",1,AFRAMER 198X,12210

Athenian Democracy and its Critics,"This course will open up ancient political thought and contemporary democratic theory through close study of Athenian politics and ideology and of the philosophical response. The ancient Athenians invented an unusually successful type of political regime and were remarkably self-conscious about what they were trying to do and how and why it worked. An important feature of their democracy was a largely sustained openness to ideas. The execution of Socrates was the exception not the rule, and dissent thrived in Athens. The philosophical work of Plato and Aristotle did not occur in isolation of or separation from the politics of the city. To an important extent, the ancient critics of Athens were also trying to cure it of what they saw as its failings. A study of key ancient Greek thinkers as critics of the democracy shines valuable light on their political theory generally. Importantly, it is only with the moderns&mdash;the Federalist Papers, Constant, Mill, Berlin, and even Rawls&mdash;that we find purely apolitical and theoretical criticism of ancient Athens. Their target is the Athenian ideal of political equality. By extending our study of critics of Athenian democracy into the contemporary period, we gain new insight about the place of the ideal of political equality in contemporary democratic theory and theories of justice.",70,GOV 2036,13465

Insights from Narratives of Illness,"A physician occupies a unique perch, regularly witnessing life&rsquo;s great mysteries:&nbsp; the miracle of birth, the perplexing moment of death, and the struggle to find meaning in suffering.&nbsp; It is no wonder that narratives of illness have been of interest to both physician and non-physician writers. This seminar will examine and interrogate both literary and journalistic dimensions of medical writing. The investigation will be chronological, beginning with &ldquo;classic&rdquo; narratives by Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Kafka, and then moving on to more contemporary authors such as William Carlos Williams, Richard Selzer, Oliver Sacks, Susan Sontag, and Philip Roth. Controversial and contentious subjects are sought in these writings: the imbalance of power between physician and patient; how different religions frame the genesis and outcome of disease; the role of quackery, avarice, and ego in molding doctors&rsquo; behavior; whether character changes for better or worse when people face their mortality; what is normal and what is abnormal behavior based on culture, neuroscience, and individual versus group norms.

We will discuss both lower and upper bounds, as well as how such mathematical programs give rise to a general theory of computational difficulty, computation vs. sample size tradeoffs, and computational analogs of Bayesian probabilities.More concretely, we will touch some of the following topics:* Upper and lower bounds for various average case problems, including random constraint satisfaction, planted clique, and problems arising from machine learning.* Speeding up Sum of Squares algorithms.* Relation to Khot&#39;s Unique Games&nbsp; Conjecture (UGC) and the SOS approach to refuting the UGC.* Can SoS be optimal algorithm in some settings? What are the&nbsp; candidate algorithms who could do better? In what settings might *linear* programming already be optimal? What kind of implication could such optimality entail?* Semidefinite extension complexity, relations to communication complexity.* Relation to statistical physics, and algorithms such as belief propagation and survey propagation.* Relation to quantum information theory, quantum entanglement, and the log rank conjecture.* Reducing asymptotic SoS questions to finite size via symmetry and relation to Razborov&#39;s flag algebras and Turan problems.However, this is a fast moving research area and our plans may change as new results, as well as new understandings of old results, come to light.

Time,"We study how our understanding of time and of related issues, such as the predictability of the future, have evolved over the past three centuries.

We then see how developments in the 19th and 20th centuries destroy this view of time. In the 19th century, the distinction between past and future emerges from considerations of statistical processes. In the 20th century, the theory of relativity forces fundamental changes in the concept of time. Time ceases to be universal and becomes entangled with space and gravity. Quantum mechanics limits the predictability of the future and introduces verified effects so weird that Einstein wrote of them, ""No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this.""",62,SCIPHUNV 18,2019

The Biology and Science of Cancer and Its Treatments: From Empiric to Scientific to Humanistic,"&ldquo;Cancer&rdquo; represents hundreds of different diseases with a wide variety of causative mechanisms, as well as enormous social impact. This seminar aims to provide an introduction to the biology of cancer and what makes a normal cell become a cancerous one, delving into acquired and inherited genetic abnormalities and effects of environmental factors, such as nutrition, radiation, and tobacco. Current approaches to cancer will be discussed from prevention and early detection to treatment and survivorship. Treatment modalities continue to evolve&mdash;no longer just surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but development of targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies, signal transduction inhibitors, vaccines, and angiogenesis inhibitors, which are rationally aimed at biological mechanisms uniquely important to the cancer cells themselves with the goal of reducing side effects of therapy and improving outcomes. Although cancer incidence continues to increase, mortality is decreasing, resulting in many more cancer survivors and a need to care for the secondary effects of the treatment and the societal impact of this disease. We will discus the field of Integrative Oncology, an evolving discipline that teats the patient as a whole and combines the best of eastern and western medicine.

Brainwashing and Modern Techniques of Mind Control,"This course examines the phenomenon of ""brainwashing"" as a modern set of techniques that can apparently force a subject radically to alter her beliefs against her will. The Cold War roots of 'brainwashing' - both the myth and the reality -- lie in the politics of twentieth-century anti-Communism and the deeper fear that people's most strongly held thoughts, ideas, and ideological commitments could be vulnerable to powerful infiltration. In order to understand the dynamics of this process we will examine case studies beginning with the Korean War-era emergence of the term 'brainwashing', the American interdisciplinary science of ""coercive persuasion"" that arose in response, and successive waves of technological, political, and sociocultural developments. We will also look at how brainwashing and analogous persuasive techniques may operate among larger groups, crowds, organizations, and mass societies.",76,HISTSCI 176,2668

"Spectral Fictions, Savage Phantasms: Race and Gender in Anti-Racist South African & African America","Why have social orders like Apartheid South Africa and White Supremacy in segregated America that are based on extreme racial, gender and national oppression always generated often violent, hallucinatory fictions of the racial and gender identities of the oppressed? And why have the oppressed in turn often internalized these sorts of fictions and also produced counter-fictions that more or less conform to the same violent, phantasmic logic? In this course, we will explore how these fictions and counter-fictions are reproduced and challenged in some of the most powerful, canonical works of drama, fiction and cinema by South African and African American authors and filmmakers. As the Nigerian author, Chinua Achebe once famously remarked: ""where one thing stands, another thing will stand beside it."" To this end, we will pay special attention in the course to how, both in form and in content, race and gender always seem, constitutively, to intersect in these fictions and counter-fictions. The course is thus a study in the dark, violent but generative cultural unconscious of modern racialized and gendered identities.",1,AFRAMER 111,39

We will grapple with communication, surveying, and weaponization of science in the twentieth century on the one hand, and with clashing accounts of explanation on the other. How (for example) does one explain the pattern of V2 rocket-bombs exploding around London in World War II? Do we learn about the location of future detonations from the ones that come earlier as Pavlov might have had it? Or is the world, at root, inextricably random, with events utterly independent one from the other as Poisson would say? Such reflections on the world--and they extend through identity, love, war, and materiality-- feed back into the very nature of writing itself, and in the final sessions of the seminar, we will turn to literary-philosophical questions such as this: How, in the absence of causality and continuity, does narrative itself function? What might be a postcausal (postmodern) novel? Along with Pynchon&rsquo;s original text, we will read widely in the history of technology, warfare, science, literary theory, and philosophy.",76,HISTSCI 292,2705

"Science and Religion: Debates, Approaches and Controversies","How is your cellphone part of religious experience? Why do some people refuse to vaccinate their children? And why do some reject evolution and global warming? What is missionary medicine and how is it related to global health? What role do religious institutions play in our lives? And why does research show that prayers can improve health outcomes? How important is Pope Francis&rsquo;s encyclical on the environment? And why should we care?!The study of science and religion has been dominated by a limited set of views that range from animosity to attempts at reconciliation. Yet, these approaches remain largely normative and are deeply rooted in particular readings of European history. In this course, we move beyond debates of conflict or harmony into deeper discussions of how scientific and religious discourses impact daily lives and how issues of race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status impact these discourses.

Legal Anthropology and Modern Governance,"This course examines changing configurations of law, power and governance. The law, and in particular the &lsquo;rule of law&rsquo; has been central to imagining and delineating the relationship between the political and the legal. In particular it is the means through which sovereign power has been conceptualized and limited. This subsumption of the political to the legal has been critiqued by Schmitt and the reduction of power to law has been challenged by Foucault. We begin by exploring these theoretical challenges to liberal legality before turning to the relationship between law and imperialism.&nbsp; In subsequent weeks we continue exploring these themes of legal regulation, emergency, exception, rights and violence through contemporary ethnographies.",6,ANTHRO 2674,216

Why Shakespeare?,We will first examine what Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet can tell us about how individuals-in particular Shakespeare himself-actively invent and renegotiate their identities within the confines of a given culture. In the third unit we will look at Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1966) and Shakespeare in Love in order to assess the extent to which we rely on the re-invention of Shakespeare's works for our own cultural identity.,54,EXPOS 20.043,11478

Cross-Cultural Contact Zones,"How does fiction represent cross-cultural encounters between Eurocentric and non-Eurocentric worlds? In what ways do the specific social and political circumstances under which these contacts occur influence the nature of the cross-cultural encounters? Do issues of power, class, and gender function differently in cross-cultural environments for the racial groups involved than they would within a single culture? In exploring literature about three kinds of cross-cultural encounters-transient, colonial/postcolonial, and immigrant-we'll pose such resonant questions.",54,EXPOS 20.068,1633
Jewish Identity in American Culture,"This course will examine representations of Jews in American culture and the evolution of Jewish-American culture since World War II, as well as how shifts in the cultural conversation about minorities in America have affected our understanding of Jewish identity.

Grounds for Comparison,"This seminar provides an introduction to literary studies in a global age. How do writers refract and transform the world around them, and the world beyond their borders? How do they celebrate or challenge their society's values and rethink their literary heritage? Writers in every culture have mobilized the resources of poetic language and literary form to delight and instruct their readers, while critics and theorists have sought to understand how writers achieve their effects. Through close reading of a range of compelling works, accompanied by major critical and theoretical statements, we will explore the relations of literature to society and theory to literature, focusing on a set of interconnected themes: travel and self-discovery, empires and their aftermath, and the politics of language and of cultural memory.",24,COMPLIT 103,588
The Surprising Science of Happiness,"After a century of studying how to cure mental illness, scientists have started to explore what makes us happy. What have they discovered? In this course, we will critically examine the findings from the new science of happiness, including research in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, psychology, and neuroscience and reveal how this work alters our understanding of what happiness is, the optimal ways to achieve and increase it, the role of circumstance in its occurrence, its effect on our physical health, and its place in human nature. We will consider the notion of a biologically determined &ldquo;hedonic set point,&rdquo; and question whether there are people who &ldquo;have started in life with a bottle or two of champagne inscribed to their credit; whilst others seem to have been born close to the pain threshold,&rdquo; as William James noted over a century ago. We will examine how the brain&rsquo;s reward circuitry generates feelings of pleasure, desire, comfort and craving, and the ways it propels us to achieve biologically significant goals. Among the questions we will consider are: What is happiness for? Can one make oneself happier by conscious effort? What are some of the myths about happiness? Finally, is happiness a worthy goal for one&#39;s life? Highlighting the most rigorous and promising work in this field, we will attempt to construct a &ldquo;happiness toolkit.&rdquo; The course will be didactic, interactive and experiential and provide an introduction to a burgeoning field of scientific inquiry.",56,FRSEMR 24K,1789
Getting to Know Charles Darwin,"Do you think you know who Charles Darwin was?&nbsp; The legend and sober-looking bearded scholar behind the most important paradigm shift in human history?&nbsp; In this seminar, we will read a selection of Darwin&#39;s publications (including parts of Darwin&#39;s seminal work, On the Origin of Species), as well as his private correspondence, paying close attention to the man behind the science as revealed by his writings.&nbsp; We will get to know Charles Darwin&mdash;the avid breeder of pigeons, lover of barnacles, devoted father and husband, gifted correspondent and tactician, and remarkable backyard scientist.&nbsp; In this latter vein, we will reproduce ten of Charles Darwin&#39;s classic Down House experiments that were central to making his case for natural selection and evolution in On the Origin of Species, as well as his many other books on natural history.&nbsp; Field trips to the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and a local pigeon fancier will provide the setting for recreating a selection of the myriad observations of organisms and their interactions with the environment and each other that made Darwin the master of minutia and provided the foundation for his grand synthesis of evolutionary pattern and process.&nbsp; Each week, we will also read, react to (through writing), and discuss Darwin&rsquo;s published writings and letters.",56,FRSEMR 24P,1791
"How Did I Get Here? Appreciating ""Normal"" Child Development","Understanding &quot;normal&quot; growth and development may seem like a relatively easy task at first. We take the nuances of developmental differences for granted because we&#39;re so accustomed to experiencing them. Nevertheless, defining normal (versus abnormal) development is a complex and controversial task. Development involves a tricky intermingling of environmental stimuli, cultural and social expectations, rapid and not always intuitive changes in brain development, temperamental differences, genetic inheritance, and mind-boggling brain plasticity. The course will start with a consideration of general themes and then move to a chronologic perspective. First, we approach child development as a dynamic force, one which simultaneously engages multiple domains: social/relational, cognitive, physical, moral. We will then switch to examine stages of development in sequence, using our understanding of neurobiological, physical, cultural, and psychological factors to inform our assessment of how children change over time. Readings will include classic papers on development, textbook chapters that provide overviews of specific developmental stages, recently published research articles on genetic inheritance, selected contemporary children&#39;s and young adult literature, personal memoirs, and short stories written about childhood.",56,FRSEMR 24U,1792
Health and Mental Health in Everyday Life,"Why do students feel ill before an exam? Why do women seem to suffer more than men from depression and eating disorders, whereas men use and abuse substances more than women? Why do some race/ethnic groups have better or worse health and mental health outcomes than others? These are some of the questions this course addresses. Using interdisciplinary perspectives we will investigate how such social and personal characteristics as gender, race/ethnicity, family background, and self-esteem impact health and mental health behaviors and outcomes. We will also examine how specific configurations of circumstances and contexts contribute to health and mental health problems. For instance, college students, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, etc., are increasingly experiencing stress and turning to amphetamines at higher rates than young adults who are not in college. One goal in these classes will be to explore causes and consequences. Another will be to understand the role of individuals themselves, their personal and social support networks, and health care professionals in developing and guiding positive strategies for coping and healing. Throughout, we traverse the boundary between health and illness in order to understand the complex web of factors that create and jeopardize well-being. Students will present analyses of the readings in class and write short papers based on class readings and discussions, as well as additional research. Students will also give two brief presentations: a team project and a representation of health and/or mental health in the arts.",56,FRSEMR 48E,1885

Literary Theory in Comparison - An Introduction,"This course explores the relationship between theory and practice in literary terms. What is &quot;theory,&quot; and why should it concern itself with literature? We&rsquo;ll be positing that for literature, reading and writing are co-extensive: literary theory is part and parcel of the field it seeks to analyze; literature is continuously seeking to elaborate its own theory. During the semester, we will be reading literary theory as a literary genre and literary texts as reflections on theory. We will shed light on these questions through a range of literary and critical texts, which we will bring into comparison. We will consider three pairings: first, Virginia Woolf&#39;s novel Orlando (1928) with her essay A Room of One&#39;s Own (1929); then, Honor&eacute; de Balzac&#39;s short story Sarrasine (1830) with its extensive commentary by Roland Barthes in S/Z (1970); finally, Jose Luis Borges&#39;s anthology of short-story Fictions (1944) with Michel Foucault&#39;s The Order of Things (1966).By engaging with these six seminal works, the course offers a focused yet comprehensive overview of some of the issues debated by literary theorists: authorship, style, gender, class, interpretation, semiotics, inter-textuality, plurality, books, libraries, knowledge and language. The students will learn how any given reading of a literary work can in fact be read as a &quot;theoretical&quot; piece; and how, in turn, theoretical criticism might be fruitfully analyzed as a work belonging to literary writing.&nbsp;",24,COMPLIT 110,13542

In this course we will read through the entire corpus of Dante's works, examining each in a different context. The contexts will include the literary traditions of courtly love and true nobility, scholastic philosophy and theology, contemporary history and political theory. The reception of Dante's works in the Renaissance and later times will also be considered.",72,HIST 2113,12445
1000 Years of Listening,"This course aims to introduce you to a variety of music, and a range of ways of thinking, talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called ""Classical"" repertory, from the medieval period to the present day, including Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, and Schoenberg. Class will explore the technical workings of music and together we will build a vocabulary for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; we will explore music as a cultural phenomenon. By the end of class, students will be equipped to embark on a lifetime of informed listening.",99,MUSIC 1,12529
Introduction to Old English: Reading Anglo-Saxon Landscapes,"A basic introduction to Old English, with special attention to literary landscapes and seascapes. After an overview of Old English grammar, we will translate excerpts that describe the lushness of paradise, the terrors of hell, the desolateness of Roman ruins, and the icy loneliness of the sea. We will also consider what these representations of the landscape can teach us about how the Anglo-Saxons connected with the natural world.",52,ENGLISH 102H,13007
Money,"Money and language as means of representation, exchange, and production. Principal literary texts include works by Shakespeare, Melville, Poe, Thoreau, Ruskin, Joyce, and Martineau as well as attention to novels where a coin is the narrator and to coins inscribed with poetic epigrams. Special consideration of the economics of literature from Aristotle to Heidegger, the relationship between monetary and aesthetic form in visual arts and cinema, and various theories of money as social fiction.",52,ENGLISH 195M,12311
Advanced Old English: Anglo-Saxons at Home,"This course deepens our sense of Anglo-Saxon culture through texts that bring its everyday, nitty-gritty details to life. We will encounter, for example, strange medical remedies as well as bawdy riddles; the domestic comforts of Beowulf's mead-hall as well as its epic battles. After a rapid review of skills taught in 102, we will translate progressively more challenging passages; transcribe from Old English manuscripts; and read John Gardner's Grendel, discussing the uses of engaging with an era that remains opaque in many ways. Class will culminate with final projects of translation, recitation, or research, which you will also present to the class in the last three sessions.",52,ENGLISH 103I,12305
The 18th-Century English Novel,"The rise of the novel, seen through eighteenth-century fiction by Defoe, Haywood, Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, and Jane Austen. Through fiction, we can live out our highest aspirations and blackest fantasies; we can imaginatively enter the minds of others and inhabit strange, sometimes terrifying alternate realities. The early novel was preoccupied with such possibilities for dislocation and change: what happens when a character ventures far from home, and how can someone rise or fall in the world? Alongside these issues, we will explore the paradoxes of ""realism,"" the problems of gender and class, and the sheer pleasure of reading fiction",52,ENGLISH 138,12306
"Writing Nature: Creativity, Poetry, Ethics, Science","What can writing tell us about nature and the relation of humans to it? Readings in William Wordsworth, Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, and Rachel Carson, who form a tradition blending poetry, ethics, and science. Additional nature and conservation writing (e.g., Susan Fenimore Cooper, Theodore Roosevelt), recent poets (e.g., Gary Snyder, Mary Oliver, Jorie Graham) and prose writers (e.g., Annie Dillard, Gretel Ehrlich, John Elder).

Seeing Things in the Enlightenment: Graduate Seminar,"This seminar on eighteenth-century novels and their philosophical surrounds situates itself at a crossroads where the histories of epistemology, the senses, and belief (both in God and in fictions) intersect. The Enlightenment described itself as the moment when an educated populace, weaned from superstition, would begin to see the world in its true colors: knowledge was to replace credulity. Our task will be to investigate its writers' investment in replaying the benighted, ""Gothic"" delusions they were meant to have put behind them. Our readings will encompass novels by Defoe, Lennox, Walpole, Radcliffe, and others, which we'll read alongside eighteenth-century philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, and twenty-first-century discussions of magic and secularism.",52,ENGLISH 238,12313

"Modern States, Islam, and Politics","This seminar examines the relationships between modern states and religion with particular attention to Islam in Muslim majority countries and beyond. We will analyze institutional arrangements from separation to establishment, and we will examine the meaning of secularism as a modern project. We will explore what the formation of the modern state owes to religion, but also how the modern state transforms religion. More broadly, the seminar will analyze the general consequences of the modern states' engagement with religion, and will explore new potential research paths. Readings will include historical, anthropological, theoretical, as well as quantitative perspectives.",160,RELIGION 1080,13005
Chinese History in the Digital Age,"The increasing availability of large quantities of spatial and biographical data presents both an opportunity and a challenge for historians. This course prepares students for this challenge by introducing a variety of computational methods for extracting, organizing and analyzing large datasets, including XML markups, relational database design, Microsoft Excel-based data management, and data visualization on GIS and network analysis platforms. Though we focus on a few selected topics in later imperial Chinese history (ca. 8th -18th century), the objective of the course is to teach a set of skills that can be applied in any scholarly or professional context and help students develop a critical understanding of the possibilities and risks of these digital tools. Class time is divided evenly between hands-on tutorials and discussion. Topics of discussion include practices of digital scholarship in and outside the field of Chinese history as well as theoretical reflections on these practices. All readings and lab materials will be in English. No prior knowledge of Chinese history, Chinese language, or programming is required.",29,CHNSHIS 170,12256
Education and Culture,"In this course, we will use culture as an analytic lens for investigating the institution and experience of school. We will examine 1) relationships and borders between schooling and broader educational contexts including families and communities; 2) schools as dynamic social and cultural systems, and 3) classrooms as sites of conflict, collaboration, and innovation in teaching and learning. Throughout, we will consider how individuals in a variety of roles &ndash; teachers, students, administrators, parents, researchers &ndash; interpret, negotiate, and respond to the practices and arrangements of schooling. We will examine the complex role of cultural factors in producing, maintaining, and potentially reducing inequalities in educational access, opportunity, and outcomes.",137,SOCIOL 135,12631
Critical Thinking and Research Proposal Writing,"A small group tutorial systematically guiding students in the writing of original, hypothesis-driven research proposals from initial topic selection through completion of a final draft.",82,BBS 330,12517
"Aquinas: Incarnation, Narration, Sacrament","At the center of the Summa of Theology, the reader finds a broad analysis of the motives and purposes of human action. But the analysis remains incomplete until Thomas takes up the incarnation, narrated life, and memorial sacraments of the Christ. Incarnation is the pedagogical principle that makes moral formation possible. It also justifies the teaching of Christian theology, not least in a summa. This course will read selected questions from Thomas's Summa. It will seek to understand the logic of divine teaching that explains God's choice to become incarnate, the events of Jesus's life, and the legacy of sacramental scenes of instruction. It will then ask how this logic was already at work in Thomas's description of moral life, perhaps especially in his treatments of the passions, the succession of laws, and vocation to a way of life.",160,RELIGION 2455,12718
Masculinities: Global Perspectives,"This course approaches masculinities not only as an aspect of individual (gender) identity and a social structure but also as symbols that convey ideas about dominance or positive values in a given society. It examines complex meanings, everyday practices, and rituals of masculinities in various societies both at the level of important social institutions as well as at the level of lived experiences of individual men (and some women). During the first half of the semester, we will focus on the making and remaking of ""hegemonic masculinity"" in the modern West, which had global ramifications, and compare it with marginalized masculinities. During the second half of the semester, we will focus on how major social institutions construct and maintain hegemonic masculinity and to what extent it is subverted or challenged; we will also examine how masculinities as symbols of dominance shape workings of the major institutions. Examples of such institutions include the military, the family, the school, business firms/organizations, and entertainment and leisure industry. Throughout this line of inquiry, we will look into the binary and hierarchical gender relations and explore an alternative to this dominant construction of gender.",137,SOCIOL 149,12634
Modern Drug Discovery: From Principles to Patients,"This course will familiarize students with central concepts in drug action and therapeutics: specifically we will cover concepts surrounding Pharmacokinetics (PK) and the intersection of PK and medicinal chemistry in both lectures and cases based discussions. These concepts are central to modern drug development and evaluation. In the course we will cover drug-target interactions, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics. This course will have a focus on modern approaches to therapeutic development for small molecules, protein based therapeutics, nucleic acid based drugs and antibacterial compounds as well new frontiers in therapeutic discovery.",83,BCMP 236,11497

Gegenwartsliteratur: Korper-Poetiken seit der Wende,"Explores German literature from the Wendezeit to the present, focusing on a number of texts that we will define as `body literature' or `corpoetics'. Rather than directly addressing the fall of the Wall, these texts employ a transgressive poetics that tears down the walls between text and body in the search for authentic communication.",65,GERMAN 260,12400
"Biopolitics and Vampire Aesthetics, 1716-2016","This course traces the infamous bloodsucker&#39;s bite-marks through major periods of European literature from the 18th century to the present, exploring how the notion of vampirism is inextricably linked with the emergence of what Michel Foucault has famously called `biopolitics&#39; or &#39;bio-power&#39;. Since the 18th century, institutions such as schools, clinics and prisons have exerted an increasing &ldquo;hold over life&rdquo; (Foucault), conditioning the ways in which we think and act. Why does the emergence of these modern institutions coincide precisely with the vampire&#39;s first appearance in European literature? Have the arts been defying the biopolitical hold over life by creating a vampiric aesthetics? We pursue these questions by engaging in a dialogue between literature, film, the natural sciences, and critical theory. Readings include canonical authors such as Goethe, Byron, Hoffmann, Baudelaire, Nietzsche, Stoker, Tawada.",65,GERMAN 170,12396
Topics in Philosophy of Mathematics: Seminar,"The topic will be the search for axioms that settle the statementsleft unsettled by ZFC. Topics include: The nature of justification inmathematics, axioms of infinity, definable determinacy, the continuumhypothesis, the HOD Conjecture, the search for a `final&#39; axiom and thecandidate V = Ultimate-L.",122,PHIL 243,12573
Philosophy of Probability,"Probability, remarked Bishop Butler, is ""the very guide of life."" In this course we will investigate the extent to which probabilistic tools can help answer basic questions like these: How should I choose among my options? What should I believe? How should I revise my beliefs upon acquiring new information? Does it make sense to believe in God? No background in math is necessary; the beginning of the course will cover the essentials of probability theory.",122,PHIL 150,12568
The Art of Living (Graduate Seminar in General Education),"From its inception in Ancient Greece, Philosophy was conceived of not merely as an intellectual pursuit, but as an entire way of life. Indeed ethics, in the words of the Roman philosopher Cicero, was essentially an ars vivendi, an art of living [De Fin. 1.42 et. al.]. This graduate seminar is devoted to developing a General Education course that approaches philosophical texts from this broad-minded perspective. In the seminar we will pursue intensive reading of figures from Socrates to Foucault, and we will discuss various pedagogical strategies and creative assignments intended to bring to life the art that each of these figures points us toward.",122,PHIL 232R,12572
Poverty in America,"Fifty Years after President Lyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty, America is still home to both abundant wealth and extreme deprivation. This course investigates poverty in America in historical and contemporary perspective. We will explore topics such as urban and rural poverty, the underground economy, and survival strategies of poor families. We will also study several large-scale anti-poverty programs with an eye toward what worked and what didn't, and we will review moral-political debates about the right to housing, living wages, welfare, social suffering, and other matters pertaining to American life below the poverty line.",137,SOCIOL 177,12640
Economic Sociology: Global Perspectives,"Sociology offers a unique perspective on economic behavior and institutions. Exploring the foundational concepts of economic sociology with examples from all over the world, this course treats the following questions, among others: How do sociological perspectives on organizations, networks, power and inequality challenge widely held assumptions about economic behavior? How can seemingly disparate cases from around the globe enrich our conceptual understanding of economy and society? Has the economy become more global over time and, if so, how? What role does finance capital play in the current dynamics and future direction of the global economy? Starting with the evolution of economic organizations, the course covers topics such as social embeddedness, markets and networks, power, labor market, globalization, economic development, and financial markets.",137,SOCIOL 139,12632
Student Experience in Global Perspective,"Explores key concepts in sociology of higher education through study of student experience, the effects of college on students, and student engagement in social change - focusing on different parts of the world. This course has a strong empirical component: student research projects will involve qualitative or quantitative methods of social analysis to investigate research questions related to student experience (through fieldwork on Harvard campus or outside of it).",137,SOCIOL 145,12633
"On Love: Gender, Sexuality, Identity","Is romantic love a life-altering ""event"" in Alain Badiou's sense? Or is it a biopolitical tool of neoliberal control in Michel Foucault's sense? This course examines love from a philosophical, psychoanalytic, critical theoretical, and cultural studies perspective. Special attention is given to the foundational role of love in how Western subjects negotiate the complexities of gender, sexuality, and identity.",149,WOMGEN 1261,12667
War Stories,"This course looks at artistic representations of modern warfare and asks what effects war has on those who survive it. How should we represent the horrors of war, and how should we remember them? By reading books by O'Brien and Hemingway, and watching films by Coppola and Bigelow, we'll debate whether the experience of war can ever be adequately communicated to those who weren't there, and whether these attempts can prevent future generations from repeating the mistakes of the past.",54,EXPOS 20.260,12328
Writing the Environment,"How are we to make sense of the high-stakes debates about the environment today? In attempting to answer this question, this course focusses on the rhetoric and not the science of environmentalism. We will look at what happens when the impressions of a naturalist or the findings of a scientist are put into language and communicated to a wider public. As we examine a range of works including Thoreau's Walden, Carson's Silent Spring, and documentary movies, we will ask how each work presents nature to the reader through the medium of language, how each attempts to persuade the reader, and each draws upon sources as varied as literary romanticism and science.",54,EXPOS 20.264,12332
Sexual Health and Reproductive Justice,"This intermediate-level seminar investigates the connections between sexuality, reproduction, public health, and social justice. We will examine how inequities related to gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and sexual orientation influence the sexual and reproductive health and rights of socially and economically marginalized groups of women in the contemporary United States, especially women of color and poor and low-income women but also lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women. Using public health and social justice lenses, we will focus on the following topics: pregnancy, birth, abortion, contraception, forced sterilization, sexual violence, cervical cancer, and HIV/AIDS.",149,WOMGEN 1253,12666
The Frankfurt School on Mass Media and Mass Culture,"This seminar considers the Frankfurt School's deliberations on film, radio, television, and mass culture. We will devote the majority of the course to three seminal figures: Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and T. W. Adorno. More generally, we will focus on the debates catalyzed by the emergence of modern mass media and an industrialized visual culture; we will also reflect on the pertinence of these debates for our own contemporary culture of media convergence.",162,VES 289,12741
Human Evolution through Developmental Change,"Humans and our primate relatives display marked variation in biological traits. This variation results from natural selection operating on pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. While these mechanisms remain mostly unknown, recent advances in genetics, genomics, and developmental biology now allow us to begin to understand how evolutionary processes influence and are influenced by underlying developmental and genetic organization. This course explores these inter-relationships in the context of the primate paleontological record. We focus on the evolution of the post-cranial skeleton (i.e., the axial skeleton, girdles, and limbs), and present studies that cast light on the mechanisms that underlie major transitions in human evolution.",78,HEB 1480,12488
Muslim Voices in Contemporary World Literatures,"What do Muslims think of acts of terrorism committed in the name of Islam, the mixing of religion with politics, the status and rights of women, the hegemony of the ""West""? This seminar investigates the viewpoints of prominent Muslim writers on these and other ""hot button"" issues as reflected in novels, short stories and poetry from different parts of the world. Explores a range of issues facing Muslim communities in various parts of the world by examining the impact of colonialism, nationalism, globalization and politicization of Islam on the search for a modern Islamic identity. Readings of Muslim authors from the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Europe and America.",56,FRSEMR 37Y,1847
The Book: From Gutenberg to the Internet,Examines the impact of books on Western culture from the time of Gutenberg. Hands-on experience in studying the book as a physical object and theoretical reflection on the nature of printing as a means of communication. Students will consider the publishing history of great books such as Shakespeare's First Folio and will address the problem of books as elements in the electronic media.,56,FRSEMR 42W,12385
Philosophy of Law,"We will look at moral issues relating to the law, especially U.S. constitutional law. Readings will include important recent and historical court cases alongside philosophical work. Topics to be discussed include the role of judges in a democracy, race and gender equality, freedom of speech, and the rule of law. For example, should judges have such a large voice on the regulation of abortion? Should corporations be allowed to spend unlimited amounts supporting political candidates? And can we put restrictions on violent pornography while respecting freedom of speech?",122,PHIL 11,12563
Moral Theories,"In this course we will consider how one ought to act. We will look at some general moral theories, including Kantianism, consequentialism, and contractualism. And we will consider the implications of these theories for particular issues, such as promising, deception, self-defense, and risk-imposition.",122,PHIL 177X,12571
Normative and Meta-Normative Questions,"We shall discuss some conflicting views about what matters, normative reasons, how it would be best for things to go, and the wrongness of acts. We shall also discuss some conflicting metaethical views about these views. The subjects discussed will partly depend on the preferences of those taking this course.",122,PHIL 268Y,12575
Society and the Witch,"Witches are often imagined to be outside society. But this socially marginal figure may provide a key to understanding social norms, norms that get articulated through the witch's very violation of them. In this course, we ask what discourses about witches tell us about the societies that produce them. We'll examine enduring fascinations with the occult in modernity, a period when magic was supposed to disappear. We'll explore topics ranging from self-identified magicians to the sensationally successful Harry Potter series. Readings draw from anthropology, folklore and mythology, gender studies, history, literature, and popular culture.",54,EXPOS 20.268,12336
Breaking the Rules,"Everyone lives by rules, no matter how free they feel. This course uses literature and film to interrogate the relationship between social rules and individual freedom while considering the following questions: What does it mean to be ""free""? How does social obligation impact our personal freedom? Are we even aware of the ways that society controls our behavior, or are rules of social conduct largely invisible? Course texts include short stories by Willa Cather, Flannery O'Connor and National Book Award winner Ha Jin, the films The Graduate and Mean Girls, and the television series Mad Men and Downton Abbey.",54,EXPOS 20.272,12340
Women's Voices in German Medieval Literature,This course examines female expression in literature from the German speaking area in the Middle Ages and comprises Yiddish literature as well as Middle High and Middle Low German texts. We focus on thorough close readings and the history of textual transmission in secular and religious spheres. The women's voices shall be enacted in a performance at the end of the term.,65,GERMAN 105,12394
Computational Science and Engineering Capstone Project,"The CSE capstone project is intended to integrate and apply the skills and ideas CSE students acquire in their core courses and electives. By requiring students to complete a substantial and challenging collaborative project, the capstone course will prepare students for the professional world and ensure that they are trained to conduct research.

Algorithm design methods, including graph algorithms, approximation algorithms, and randomized algorithms. Models of computation, computability theory, and computational complexity, including the P vs. NP question.",50,COMPSCI 125,12277
Reconstruction in American Memory,"Reconstruction - the period of economic rebuilding and philosophical reorientation that followed the American Civil War - was an unprecedented moment of historical rupture. Reconstruction sought quite simply to remake an entire society at once, from one day to the next replacing slavery with the ideals of free labor and democratic participation. In this seminar, we will consider Reconstruction as a set of historical events and as a narrative problem. In other words, while learning about this unheralded moment of change in American history, we will also ask how Reconstruction became a story to be passed down from one generation to the next - by novelists, poets, historians, political scientists, and filmmakers.",56,FRSEMR 35I,12366
Energy within Environmental Constraints,"This course provides a systematic introduction to the energy system for students in engineering and applied sciences. Students should gain a working understanding of the some of the most important energy technologies, from prime movers--gas turbines, steam cycles, and reciprocating engines--to secondary energies including fuel production and refining technologies and the electricity transmission and distribution system. The course aims at a systematic understanding of the energy system's environmental footprint as a tool to help students who will work to reduce it. Energy is a commodity. One cannot hope to re-shape the energy system to meet environmental constrains without a rough working understanding of energy markets--costs, prices and elasticities of supply and demand. So the course will integrate engineering economics and other applied social sciences into the treatment of energy technologies to enable a system's view of energy.",51,ENG-SCI 137,12286
Nano Micro Macro: Adaptive Material Laboratory,"This course explores research methods and techniques through the analyses of emerging energy-efficient materials and systems and their applications in buildings. It serves as an interdisciplinary platform for engineers, materials and computer scientists to interact with the design students and develop new products. The course introduces ideas-to-innovation processes in a hands-on, project/product focused manner that balance engineering concepts with promising, real-world opportunities. Switching back and forth between guided discovery and focused development, between bottom-up and top-down thinking, and market analyses, the course helps students establish generalizable frameworks as researchers and innovators with a focus on new and emerging technologies.",51,ENG-SCI 291,12291
"Women and War: Gender, Race, and the Politics of Militarism","This course examines scholarship on gender, sexuality, and race within a multitude of feminist disciplines in order to suggest productive interventions in analyses of women and warfare. Refuting essentialized notions of womanhood as passive, peaceful, and submissive, this class encourages students to move beyond thinking about what men and women do in war, and instead consider how gendered constructs are necessary for war. Memoirs, documentaries, military policy, and legal cases will serve as case studies to analyze contemporary and historical issues of gender and militarism.",149,WOMGEN 1271,12668
Global Reproductive Health,"This interdisciplinary seminar examines how gender, poverty, development and global health policies, legacies of colonialism, and social institutions influence sexual and reproductive health outcomes (pregnancy, maternal health, HIV/AIDS, cervical cancer, sexual violence) and access to sexual and reproductive health services (family planning, abortion, HIV testing and counseling, cervical cancer screening) among women in low-income countries. We will address how social and economic context affect&nbsp;women&#39;s sexual and reproductive health across countries in the Global South&nbsp;and examine how inequities based on socioeconomic position, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, and sexuality shape women&#39;s sexual and reproductive health inequities within these countries. Further, we will discuss how community-based health interventions that target the social determinants of health at multiple levels can help promote the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women in low-income countries.",149,WOMGEN 1272,12669
Japan and the Atomic Bomb in Historical Perspective,"The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 marked the intersection of warfare and science that was more than a century in the making. What motivated scientists to participate in the creation of the bombs? How did civilian populations become justifiable targets in modern warfare? What was it like to experience nuclear attack? Does the historical evidence confirm the popular conception that these bombings ended World War Two in the Pacific? This course examines these and related questions using a broad range of sources, including poetry and fiction, de-classified government documents, and readings in the history of science.",72,HIST 1092,12435
"Science and Islam: Agents, Places, and Controversies","The course addresses the history of questions of science and religion in the Middle East from the medieval to the modern period, looking at how different scientific and religious views and discourses interacted through history. From translation of Greek science and philosophy in the ninth century, to educational reform, legalizing dissection, and organ transplantation, the course surveys important discussions on science and religion in the Middle East and Islamic world, and sees how scientific and religious views and discourses developed over time. The course pays special attention to questions of colonialism, translation, and the development of different institutions of learning in the Middle East.",76,HISTSCI 109,12472
The Crowd in History: From the Hunting Band to the Social Network,"This seminar treats the crowd as historical subject from prehistory to the present. We examine what it means to talk about ""crowds"" across various historical settings and collective behaviors. We proceed from hunting bands to social networks, analyzing gladiatorial crowds in Rome, crusader armies in the Middle Ages, revolutionary crowds in America, France, and Britain, twentieth-century mass politics (democratic, fascist, and communist), crowd theorists (Seneca, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Marx, Le Bon, Freud, Canetti), and postwar protesters, shoppers, fun-seekers, and smart mobs. Topics include community formation, ritual, entertainment, crowd psychology, the history of labor, revolution and protest, class, gender, and war.",72,HIST 60I,12421

"Mapping Cultural Space: Sites, Systems & Practices across Eurasia","Year-long bi-weekly interdisciplinary seminar on the production of social, cultural, and political space in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. Physical and urban space will receive particular attention. Includes individual and collaborative work with digital tools for research, analysis, and presentation. Key questions: How can diverse mapping practices (geographical, scholarly and disciplinary, discursive, artistic) illuminate Eurasian cultural politics? How can we analyze cultural space as a dynamic product of cultural activity, as well as a framework for the evolution and transmission of beliefs, behaviors, memories, and values?",134,SLAVIC 270HF,12620
Intersection of Polish and Jewish Culture,"A survey-style course that recreates several major moments of intersection between Polish and Jewish literatures. Both of these categories can be understood as placeholders for larger constellations of culture: from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to the Ashkenazic Pale. Starting with the medieval ghetto, the presence/absence of Polish Jews in Polish cultural memory forms one line of inquiry; Polin as a present/absent homeland in Jewish thought from the 16th through 21st centuries forms another.

Anthropology and Africa,"This undergraduate course explores the links between race, empire, and the production of anthropological knowledge about Africa. Africa has occupied a central place in the making of anthropology as a discipline. Ethnographic studies of African contexts generated leading theories of kinship and society, money and economy, ritual and religion, violence, law, and political order. And, while anthropologists have often used their work to critique racism and social injustice, the discipline of anthropology has been, at times, accused of being the &ldquo;handmaiden of colonialism&rdquo; &ndash; its discourses complicit in the making of dominant ideologies of racial alterity and imperial power. In this course, students revisit moments of intersection between the history of modern Africa and the history of anthropology in order examine the role of knowledge production in the politics of world-making. We interrogate &ldquo;Africa&rdquo; as an ideological category, a source of identity and collective consciousness, and a geo-political context of social life. We ask: What is the political potential of various forms of knowledge production? What do ethnographic engagements with African contexts offer by means of understanding the world at large? And what may anthropological thinking offer by way of envisioning better futures in Africa and beyond?",1,AFRAMER 105X,12202

Hellenistic Sculpture,"Hellenistic sculpture manifests a revolution in Greek aesthetics. In the late 4th century BCE, with the emergence of royal patronage, we see radical shifts in art theory and in the artworks themselves. The aesthetic newness of Hellenistic sculpture lies in the choice of themes and represented moments, the modes of contextual display, as well as in the treatment of sculptural three-dimensionality and surface sensualism; its cultural 'modernity' lies in its almost boundless geographic scope. Based on a series of case studies, the seminar will discuss the socio-political implications of Hellenistic sculpture, as well as central hermeneutic issues at stake, such as concepts of involved spectatorship, lifelikeness, style and meaning, space and nature, theatricality, emotion in the arts, notions of otherness (barbarians, peasants, and cripples) and the divine.",75,HAA 138S,12456

Psychology and Economic Theory,"This course explores ways that psychological research indicating systematic departures from classical economic assumptions can be translated into formal models that can be incorporated into economics. Topics include ways utility theory can be improved--such as incorporating reference dependence, news utility, social preferences, self image, and other belief-based tastes--and ways we can relax assumptions of perfect rationality--such as incorporating focusing effects, limited attention, biased prediction of future tastes, present-biased preferences, biases in probabilistic judgment, and errors in social inference. The course will emphasize (a) careful interpretation and production of new evidence on relevant departures,(b) formalizing this evidence into models that can, with discipline and rigor, generate sharp predictions using traditional economic approaches, and (c) exploring economic implications of those models presented. Although we will primarily emphasize (b), the course is meant to be useful to students whose interests lie anywhere in this spectrum, under the premise that all such research will be improved by a greater appreciation of the full spectrum. The course is intended for PhD students in the Business Economics and Economics programs and others who have a solid background in microeconomic theory at the level of introductory PhD courses in these programs. While obviously appropriate to those wishing to specialize in ""behavioral economics"", the course is also designed for those interested in doing research in particular fields of economics. And while the course centers on theoretical models (learning and evaluation will center around solving formal problem sets), the theory is focused towards its empirical implementability and economic relevance, so that the course is also designed for those interested in theory-influenced empirical research.",45,ECON 2035,12267

Morality and Its Critics,"An introduction to ethics, focusing on two representative views of the nature and significance of morality. On one (utilitarianism), morality is roughly about doing what best serves the interests of everyone involved; on the other (associated with Immanuel Kant) it instead concerns relating to people on terms that respect their dignity and autonomy. We&#39;ll explore these views in the context of issues ranging from animal rights and global poverty to happiness, manipulation, and responsibility, and we also consider whether both views might seriously exaggerate the place of morality in our lives.",122,PHIL 13,12564
Mood Disorders,"The goal of this course is to give an overview of the major research findings across mood disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Every class will involve classic and cutting edge research from the literature on mood disorders. The class will also involve discussion of psychological (i.e., therapeutic) and psychiatric (i.e., medical) perspectives on etiology and treatment. By the end of the course, students will understand the etiology, course, and treatment of a variety of mood disorders.",124,PSY 1855,12594
Class and the City in Indian Cinema,"This course will examine imaginaries and understandings of class and cities in Indian cinema. How are struggles for earnings and mobility in the city - of migrants, workers, and middle classes - represented in Indian cinema? In what ways is the city viewed as a space of ethical deviations and compromises? How does class shape experiences of friendship, family, and erotic love? What visions of politics, justice, and hope arise in Indian cinema? The course will explore these questions in commercial, art, and documentary films (in Bengali, Hindi, and Marathi, with English subtitles), along with readings in history, anthropology, and cinema studies. Screenings will include films by Satyajit Ray, Guru Dutt, Raj Kapoor, Yash Chopra, Muzaffar Ali, and Anand Patwardhan.",141,SAS 193,12649
"Stress, Coping, and Resilience","The goal of this course is to give an in-depth understanding of the theoretical and empirical work on stress (e.g., negative life events, psychological and physiological stress), coping, and resilience. Theories of stress will be discussed from social, cognitive, and biological perspectives. Major focus will be given to the study of resilience to stress and related topics (e.g., psychopathology, self-injury) through the lens of positive psychology. By the end of the course, students will understand the causes, course, and consequences of stress and resilience to stress.",124,PSY 1858,12596
Psychological Challenges of Adolescence and Early Adulthood,"This seminar will examine research on a wide range of developmental, social, and psychological processes that affect the mental health of adolescents and young adults. We will discuss factors that facilitate resilience during adolescence and the transition to adulthood (such as personality traits and economic resources), as well as risk factors (such as parental maltreatment and exposure to violence). We will also explore questions specific to disorders common during this developmental period, such as whether adolescent mood and anxiety disorders are unidimensional or bideminsional constructs, and how recent social and neurobiological research can enhance our understanding of the unique challenges faced by adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Throughout the course, we will discuss research on emerging trends in media use and Facebook, and the impact of these technologies on depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and cyberbullying.",124,PSY 980U,12587
Introduction to Digital History,"This course trains students in a range of digital methods used for the acquisition, analysis, and visualization of data in the context of historical research. Beyond developing practical skills, students will learn how to critically evaluate the potential and limitations of new technologies, and how to integrate them into their work in a careful, theoretically informed way.",72,HIST 1993,12444
Marie de France and ChrÃ_Â€Â¨ÃçÃ_Â‰ÂŒÂ©tien de Troyes or the Beginning of Modern Fiction,"We will read the complete works of the most famous French authors of the twelfth century: Marie de France's Lais, Fables, and Purgatory of St. Patrick; ChrÃ_Â€Â¨ÃçÃ_Â‰ÂŒÂ©tien de Troyes's five Arthurian romances, two love songs, and adaptation of Ovid's story of Philomela. We will also read other contemporary narrative works, helping us to reflect on the role of fiction in medieval culture and in our own culture.",126,FRENCH 105,12601
Neuroscience Fiction: An Introduction to Cutting Edge Neuroscience through the Lens of Film and Tele,"Film and television shows often capture the cutting edge of science, and they sometimes even anticipate future scientific advances. We'll use examples from film and television as an introduction to several hot topics in the field of neuroscience, such as Mind Control, Mind Reading, Smart Pills, and Brain Machine Interfaces, which are all getting closer to reality. Will neuroscientists ever be able to control a person's thoughts, or to know what a person is thinking? Can taking a pill really awaken untapped brain power? Will you ever be able to drive a car without touching a steering wheel? In this course, we will cover the state of the art and the future of these exciting areas of neuroscience (and entertainment). Because these are not textbook topics, this is an advanced course that will focus on reading and discussing the primary literature.",124,PSY 1454,12590
How to Nudge: Using Social Psychology and Decision Science to Change Behavior and Policy,"How do you get people to waste less energy, save more money, and eat healthier? How do you encourage people to vote, stay in school, and drive safer? In this course you will learn relevant social psychology and decision science, as well as a promising new methodology useful for motivating and nudging people's behaviors to reduce or solve specific problems in organizations and society. By succeeding in this class you will gain identifiable skills that are applicable beyond the classroom (e.g., to improve programs, policies, organizational practices), in a variety of settings (e.g., health, education, law, public policy, business, and the environment).",124,PSY 1508,12593
Social Cognition: Making Sense of our Social World,"As a social species, a significant proportion of our everyday thoughts are devoted to social cognition - thinking about other people and comprehending what they are thinking about us. In this course we will merge theories from social and cognitive psychology to examine how people make sense of each other, social groups, and the surrounding social world. Throughout the course, we will draw on neuroscientific findings to uncover the neural basis of these abilities, as well as examine deficits in these social skills in autism and related disorders.",124,PSY 1504,12592
From the Book to the Kitchen Table,"An exploration of the ideas and identities of Italy through food, beginning with Pellegrino Artusi&rsquo;s seminal gastronomic writing, and moving through historical, linguistic, sociological pathways. In addition to various texts, students will engage in hands-on kitchen experiences. Frequent oral and written assignments reinforce language skills and academic literacy in the target language.",127,ITAL 105,12603
Circuits and Symptoms,"This class will explore the biology of psychological illness. We will ignore artificial diagnostic labels, examining instead the core symptom domains that have plagued humans since the beginning of recorded history. A strong emphasis will be placed on biological mechanisms. In particular, the class will focus on mapping dysfunction in large-scale brain circuits to cognitive, affective, social, and motivational symptom domains, and on understanding how genes and environments act and interact to predispose these symptoms by shaping brain function and development.",124,PSY 1251,12588
Topics in Music from 1800 - Present,"Music Since 1945.&nbsp; A survey of music since the Second World War, including concert music, jazz, experimental, and traditional, focusing mainly on North America and Europe.",99,MUSIC 193RS,12534
"Physics of Living Systems: Organism, Populations and Evolution","In this class we introduce discuss physical and quantitative aspects of multi-scale organization in biology. We will study the mechanics, dynamics and statistical physics of embryonic development, and see how physics-based approaches are used in an attempt to understand cancer. We will look at collective animal behaviors, the dynamics of population, ecology and extinction. Finally, we will study models of evolution and population genetics.",123,PHYSICS 141A,12581
"Mediterranean Crossings: Exiles, Migrants and Refugees","The Mediterranean has long been the locus of a turbulent history and of vast population movements. This course will focus specifically on the period since the middle of the twentieth century, that is, since decolonization in North Africa and the Middle East. Civil wars, political strife and economic hardship push many into voluntary, forced or even metaphoric exile, lead to massive migrations and produce refugees in record numbers. This course will study some of these movements with a triple focus on exiles, migrants and refugees, as seen through literary works and film. We will ask what artistic practices contribute and how they mediate these contexts.",126,FRENCH 174,12602
Strategy and Crisis,"The moment of crisis is the moment of discrimination: it forces decisions of obvious consequence, pitting rival theories and their proponents against one another. The crisis is par excellence the moment at which theory and practice meet. This course offers two analytical perspectives based on the study of twelve crises that are frequently seen as turning points in the modern era. To contextualize each crisis, be it political, economic, military, or a combination, we explore what the dominant theories were at the time and how they were deployed in practice in the heat of the crisis. (We may think of this a vertical, historically oriented axis of understanding.) Then we examine the linkages between crises. Are there modes of behavior or thought that are of general utility in such moments? Can strategic thought ever truly claim to be universally applicable. (We may think of this as a horizontal, thematic axis of understanding.) The course at its core is an argument for bringing history back into the core of strategic thought.",72,HIST 1995,12748
Korean Literature: Early Times to the Early 20th Century,"This lecture course introduces students to select representations of Korean literature through literary works and their contexts from the 9th through the early 20th centuries. Lectures will be on the socio-cultural, historical, political, and philosophical contexts within which the texts, their writers' lives, their customs, their worldviews were embedded. Readings include original texts in translation and parallel scholarly commentaries. Students will read diverse genres of writing including biographies, memorials, poetry, songs, letters, fictional prose, travelogues, memoirs, folklore, and p'ansori. Some of our literary texts may perfectly fit our understanding of what a literary text is supposed to be, while others will challenge us to expand the boundaries of what we define as literature. The course aims to uncover sensibilities that constituted what Koreans during this period perceived as literary and literature-like. Combining lectures and deep reading of the course materials for class discussions, the course also uses visual representations such as paintings, maps, and old books, and portrayals of traditional Korean literary practices in film and television. Those interested in East Asian literature, history, and society will find this course useful.",39,KORLIT 110,12746
Korea through Ideologies of Languages and Writing: Seminar,"Koreans before the 20th century used literary Chinese and Chinese characters as the primary means of written expression. Present-day Koreans find this a vexing fact. What ideas of language and writing underpin such collective discomfort? This course examines how discourses on language and writing in Korea have shaped the ways in which Koreans imagined literary practices, cultural identity, power, gender, and literature. Our focus is Korea's long-time participation in and modern abandonment of the Sinographic Cosmopolis, but some of the readings will illustrate parallel cases of language ideologies in Japan, Vietnam, and China.",39,KORLIT 211,12747
Surveillance: Legal and Ethical Issues,"Recent leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have revealed widespread surveillance by the U.S. government. It is easy to denounce the NSA's activities as Orwellian, or, on the other hand, to reassure ourselves that surveillance only harms those with something to hide. This course seeks to move beyond these simplistic responses. We will begin with a careful exploration of the concept of privacy. We will then turn to the specifics of the NSA's surveillance programs, both within the United States and overseas. We will examine the constitutionality of these programs and the broader policy questions they raise.",54,EXPOS 20.284,12751
"Colonialism, Globalization, and Culture in Asian Diaspora(s)","This course takes a cultural approach to historical developments of Asian diaspora, colonialism, and globalization through the lenses of appearance and performance. We examine performative and cultural arenas including literary fiction, spectacles, and visual texts to examine efforts to strategically use discourses of race, gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and (trans)nationalism to structure and maintain colonial forces. This class pushes us to consider how marginalized individuals and communities also used the same arenas to resist and critique colonial subjugation.",73,HIST-LIT 90BG,12766
Looking Back: Re-imagining an Introduction to the History of Western Art (Graduate Seminar in General Education),"Since its beginnings, the history of art has been conceived of as a teleological process defined largely in terms of progress, culminating in the triumph of modernism. As a counter-heuristic, we will teach the history of art from the present and looking back to the past. After an historiographical introduction, focused on Vasari, Winckelmann, Hegel and historicism, also in reverse, each section will consist of a critical chain of appropriations made by modern artists who constructed their own understanding of tradition, ending in Antiquity. Each section will focus on a major artist.",75,HAA 268X,12770
Understanding Histories of Tibet,"This course introduces two histories of Tibet. The first history begins from the remote past, covering the evolution of political, religious and ideological institutions on the Tibetan plateau from the 7th century until the present. The second history is that of the more recent past, when the first history was used, misused or abused in the scholarly domain and beyond. The close intermingling of these two histories - and the frequent pretense of one as the other - makes ""Tibet"" uniquely useful in our understanding the very nature of the humanistic inquiry that we call history. Instead of looking at the Tibetan plateau as a self-sufficient unit of historical analysis, this course situates the Tibetan plateau between China, India, Central Asia, Western Asia and the ""West."" Specifically, students will be introduced to themes such as: the changing domains of the Tibetan cultural areas; Buddhism's historical and historiographical conquests of Tibet; the usefulness of the vocabulary ""Golden"" as well as ""Dark"" ages in linear historical narratives; the process of consecration of historical persons such as Songtsen Gampo and the Dalai Lamas; the subjugation of and resistence to Tibet as a part of ""Chinese"" history; the highly contextual representations of Tibet and Tibetan history. No prior knowledge is required.",144,TIBET 190,12771
Word and Object in Premodern Japan,"Written texts are never separate from the material culture in which they are embedded. In premodern societies as in modern ones, the written word is an inseparable part of objects, both those in and on which it is written, and those in which it is stored, on which it is read, which it describes and alongside which it is placed. In the case of premodern Japan, the aesthetic and technological developments that produce new forms of material culture are often mirrored in literature, and vice versa. Therefore this course is designed as a survey of both premodern Japanese literature (in English translation) from the 8th through 19th centuries, and of the material and visual culture of those same eras. This course aims to explore the correspondences and differences among various texts and objects in premodern Japan,and in doing so introduce students to the possibilities of a multidisciplinary approach to scholarship in the humanities.",36,JAPNLIT 141,12764
Topics in Economic Theory,"Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior. How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors? We bring together models and techniques from sociology, economics, math, physics, statistics, and computer science to answer these questions.&nbsp; The course is aimed at a graduate level, but accessible for advanced undergraduates who have are comfortable with matrix algebra and statistics.&nbsp; The course begins with some empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks. Next, the course covers a set of models of how networks form, including random network models as well as strategic formation models, and statistical models for working with data.&nbsp;&nbsp; The course then discusses a series of models of how the structure of social networks impacts human behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.",45,ECON 2098,12765
"Sages, Saints, and Shamans: An Introduction to Korean Religions","In this course, we will explore the histories, doctrines, rituals, and practices of the major religious traditions of Korea, including Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity, as well as Shamanism and new religions. We will look at how these religions have interacted with each other, as well as the ways in which they have been both influenced and been shaped by Korean culture and politics. We will also pay close attention to the ways in which Korea has developed its own distinctive religious traditions on the basis of active interactions with those of other countries: Korea was exposed to Buddhism, Confucianism, and Catholicism through China, as well as Protestantism which was brought directly from the West. We will explore how Koreans not only transformed these imported traditions and incorporated elements of their own indigenous traditions to meet their own religious needs, but also served as active agents or participants in the development, for example, of pan-East Asian religious traditions such as Hwaom/Huayan/ Kegon Buddhism.",33,EASTD 108,12774

Lab in Intergroup Neuroscience,"Year-long lab course exploring how cognition, affect, neural responses, and behavior change when social relations shift from ""me and you"" to ""us and them."" Students will participate in experiment development and data collection employing methods ranging from standard laboratory experiments, implicit and explicit self-reports, and behavioral measures, to fMRI and psychophysiology. Students will also read and discuss papers on intergroup relations in our weekly meetings.",124,PSY 2620R,12778
"Sex, Race, and The Visual: Studies in Art and Literature","This course will examine categories of race, gender, sex, and sexuality through the lens of the visual. Using contemporary literature, photography, performance art, film, and theories of the visual, our task is to investigate the import and utility of embodiment. How do race, gender, and sexuality function in artistic imaginary? What can we glean from cultural productions that engage the viewer/reader in ways that challenge ideas about conformity, fluidity, belonging, and self-reflection? More than a linear literary or theoretical trajectory, this course will provide a template for all the mechanisms of the visual-psychological and ocular, interpretive, rhetorical and performative.",149,WOMGEN 1467,12781
The Politics of Economic Development in the Post-Cold War Era,"How can the transition to a market economy be managed? What is the impact of globalization? What are the politics and policies that contribute to rapid economic growth? To answer these questions, this course starts by examining China's rapid economic growth in the last 35 years. The Chinese case is then placed in comparison to other post-communist countries, East Asian developmental states, and finally liberalizing countries in the developing world. Through these comparisons, the course covers the main theoretical debates about the economic development in the field of comparative politics.",136,SOC-STD 98OJ,12780
Introduction to Journalism,"An intense seminar for those interested in understanding the changing role of journalism and in learning the art of reporting and writing narrative stories. The course is intended for those contemplating careers as journalists or because they want a better sense of how journalism really works. Coursework will include two narrative articles that are ready for publication. Readings will include some of the best examples of modern journalism, from magazine features by authors including Gay Talese to multimedia narratives such as The New York Times' ""Snow Fall.""",52,ENGLISH CIJR,12776
Graduate Seminar: Transatlantic Poetics,"The seminar studies transatlantic enterprises of Spain and Portugal through their prolific cultures of textuality. Epic, chronicles, lyric and other 15th to 17th-century genres will be scrutinized for influences of Atlantic itineraries, real and imagined, on projects of poetic ""making"".

Thinking with Collections,"Anthropologists have to varying degrees been interested in the social nature of works of art and other material objects since the founding of the discipline, but especially in objects created outside of western societies, the traditional domain of art historians. In art history, recent years have witnessed a shift toward a more global scope of research and away from Eurocentric definitions of what constitutes art, even as anthropological interest in all forms of art and art making continues to expand. This seminar will examine broad issues in material anthropology using objects from across multiple Harvard collections, including the Harvard Art Museums, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Houghton Library, the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, and other collecting entities. Ample consideration will be given to the making of objects, in a variety of artistic, cultural, and historical contexts. Theoretically and historically informed object-based investigations will enable seminar participants to discover new ways of using Harvard collections as an intellectual resource, critically examine exhibitionary strategies, and gain an understanding of complex collecting practices and politics, all within a comparative, cross-institution framework. Students will produce original work based on primary research conducting in Harvard collections.",6,ANTHRO 1650,12785
The Psychology of Well-being,"This course will critically examine the nature of well-being, happiness and the good life. This course will cover a range of topics such as: optimal functioning, strengths, values, interests, mindfulness, physical health, and happiness. Through group and class discussions, involved exercises, projects, videos, and review of journal articles, students will: (i) gain an understanding of well-being related concepts, (ii) learn to think critically and analytically about issues related to positive psychology, (iii) experience the effects of applying well-being related principles on your own personal growth, (iv) propose an intervention to bring about change in a well-being related behavior.",124,PSY 1001,12786
Social Bonds and Human Connections,"As social beings, humans have a fundamental need to affiliate and bond with each other. In this course, we will trace social relationships across the human lifespan, from parent-infant attachment to adolescent peer relationships to pair bonding in adulthood. In doing so, we will discuss the evolutionary benefits of this social motive and the dissolution of social bonds. We will also examine current issues in psychological science especially relevant to social bonds, including online relationships and the role of oxytocin.",124,PSY 1553,12787
The Social Brain,"Many believe that the human brain evolved to support the complex demands of interacting with other people. In this class, we will explore how our brains are wired to allow us to know ourselves, to know what other people are thinking, and predict what they might do, and to regulate our actions to most effectively interact with others. We will combine theories and findings from social psychology, evolutionary psychology, and neuroscience to work towards an understanding of the brain in a social context.",124,PSY 1559,12788
Ethics and International Relations,"How should ethical considerations shape the conduct of international politics? This course will address this question both from a theoretical perspective and with reference to events in international politics. Specific issues considered in this course will include state sovereignty, military intervention, human rights, and distributive justice.",70,GOV 94ET,12793
Development Economics,"This course will cover macro-economic topics including aggregate and non-aggregate growth models, models of technology diffusion and choice; topics in finance including financial development and economic growth, consumer finance; small and medium enterprise finance; debt and equity markets; the role of management and corporate governance; the political economy of finance, and corruption; and a range of topics on the role of population, culture, ethnicity, leaders, corruption in economic development, and the efficacy of industrial policy and foreign aid.",45,ECON 2390,12792
Re: History Memory and Imagination from Camus to Annie Ernaux,"We will consider the specific link between memory and imagination in the French novel dealing with History during the second half of the 20th century til today. Readings include major authors (Camus, Antelme, Duras, Perec, Simon, Semprun, Modiano, Ernaux) as well as historical and theoretical texts (Ginzburg, Sontag, Certeau, Rothberg, Agamben...). We'll thus explore the way of ""transcribing History, by recording it (Rec:), rewinding it (Rew:), reviewing it and replying to it (Re: History).",126,FRENCH 189,12798

"Imperial Encounters and Cultural Transformation in Central Asia, 1865-1991","The Russian and Soviet empires acted both as direct agents of transformation and as facilitators of cross-cultural contact in Central Asia, shaping the region in both intended and unintended ways. This course will examine the patterns of cultural change in Central Asia in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries while investigating possible parallels to other contexts of colonial rule and cultural ""globalization"" worldwide. What role did factors like violence, the dissemination of new ideas and goods, and the creation of an indigenous elite play in bringing about cultural change? In what ways were imperial rule and cross-cultural contact disruptive to local societies, and in what ways (and for whom) were they productive? What opportunities were there for exercising individual agency and what were the constraints on it? Topics discussed in the course will include Islam, gender, national identities, and clan and tribal relationships.",72,HIST 60K,12803

American Indian History in Four Acts,"Both scholars and tribal people (not mutually exclusive!) have found it useful to structure American Indian history around four broad chronological categories emerging from the formation of United States Indian policy: Treatymaking, Indian Removal, Land Allotment, and Self-Determination. This seminar will use this ""four acts"" structure to offer a broad overview of American Indian history, while also considering the limitations of such category-making, including the decentering of Indian people and the blunting of historical complexity. Engaged with primary sources and historiography, the course will also allow students to engage in original research in the field of American Indian history.",72,HIST 60O,12811
An Introduction to Issues in American Indian Studies: Black Elk Speaks,"First published in 1932, Black Elk Speaks is a defining text through which non-Indian people have made sense of American Indians-and through which Indian people have imagined a collective self. At once epic spiritual account, editorial curiosity, political text, war story, nineteenth century memoire, and travel narrative, the book opens a range of questions and themes critical to American Indian Studies. This course will use Black Elk Speaks to consider issues of authorship, historical consciousness, religion and spirituality, colonialism, modernity, and the complexities of cultural production, while allowing students to engage in original research in the field.",72,HIST 1996,12812

Current Issues in U.S. Environmental Law,"This course examines some of the main U.S. environmental laws, the methods of regulation and enforcement represented by those laws, and current controversies regarding their implementation and development. Each week's class will be divided between a discussion of key cases and regulations implementing a particular law and an in-depth examination of a case study involving the law under examination.",53,ESPP 90X,12818
Sexuality and Political Economy,"This seminar explores the complex links between sexuality, capitalism, and power. Sexuality has long represented a central domain for the creation and contestation of subjects and sovereignties, labor and capital, relatedness and belonging, desire and development, security and violence. With the publication of Michel Foucault&rsquo;s The History of Sexuality (1976), the role of modern forms of power that work to discipline subjects and regulate populations has become central to how scholars conceptualize sexuality. By comparison, however, the relation between sexuality, the capitalist economy, and the myriad forms of postcolonial sovereignties has only recently become the topic of rigorous analysis. In this seminar, we revisit classic works by Freud, Foucault, Lacan and Fanon as well as texts in feminist, queer and postcolonial theories in order to craft a conceptual vocabulary for understanding emerging configurations of sex and politics in late capitalism. We ask: Under what historical circumstances does sexuality become a marker of inclusion, exclusion or exceptionalism in relation to race, ethnicity, culture, and state politics? What are the relations between commodities, discourses of sexuality, and the erotic practices of concrete historical actors? And what do we learn about globalization when we think of sexuality as a central domain of economic production, social reproduction, and political belonging?",6,ANTHRO 2614,12821
Revolutionary Ukraine: Between the Russian Revolution and the Euromaidan of 2014,"Focus on Ukrainian avant-garde literature and film, in the context of modernism, socialist realism, the impact of Stalinism, the famine (Holodomor), WWII and the Holocaust, late Sovietism and dissent, Crimea and the Tatars, collapse of the USSR and independence, varieties of post-modernism, and the present conflict with Russia. Also forays into visual art.",134,SLAVIC 167,12824
New European democracies: the 2016 Spanish democratic revolution in a comparative perspective,"This seminar aims to develop an in-depth understanding of modern Democracy&rsquo;s discontent through the Spanish case study in a comparative perspective. In 40 years Spain has turned from being an exemplary model of transition to democracy to a leading example of disaffection with political and economic elites. The Indignados movement and two new political parties (Podemos and Ciudadanos) unexpectedly emerged and within two years have come to govern the&nbsp; largest cities (Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia) and are becoming the most influential political parties in the most important regional governments (Andalucia, Madrid, and Valencia). Is this a model for democratic transformation in Europe? Can citizens really change traditional political party agendas or replace them?",70,GOV 94ES,12835
Informal Robotics/New Paradigms for Design and Construction,"Today, robotic devices are being made from folded paper, carbon laminates or soft gels. Rather than assembled, they can be formed directly from 2D or 3D printer. These Informal robots are light, flexible, compliant, highly customized, and demonstrate programmable behavior that is closely coupled with material composition. Taught in collaboration with the Wyss Institute, the course will focus on techniques to create original robotic devices. Lectures will be organized along four primary topics: Kinematics, Fabrication, Controls and Applications. There will be assignments to produce test mechanisms and CAD models, followed by semester-long group projects.",51,ENG-SCI 256,12834
Modern Survey: Civilization and Barbarism in Latin American Literature,"In Latin American literature, the opposition between civilization and barbarism has defined America since its ""discovery"" by Columbus. With a focus on the intersections of time, space, language and violence in seminal texts, we look at ways their authors position the Americas and their peoples in universal history. We will also consider the role of the public intellectual and writer as political figure and founder of new national movements. Authors include Columbus, Las Casas, Teresa de Mier, Sarmiento, Marti, Dario, Gallegos, Cesar Vallejo, Borges, Arguedas, Vargas Llosa, Fernando Vallejo and Bolano.",132,SPANSH 71CB,12838
Figures and Fictions of Venture Capital and the Law in the Spanish Conquest,"What is a conquest? How does enterprise (empresa) relate to chivalry, conquest and business?

"Comparative Slavery & the Law: Africa, Latin America, & the US: Seminar","This seminar surveys the booming historiographies of slavery and the law in Latin America, the United States, and Africa. Earlier generations of scholars relied heavily on European legal traditions to draw sharp contrasts between U.S. and Latin American slavery. The most recent scholarship, however, approaches the legal history of slavery through slaves&#39; legal initiatives and actions. These initiatives were probably informed by the Africans&#39; legal cultures, as many of them came from societies where slavery was practiced. Our seminar puts African legal regimes (customary law, Islamic law) at the center of our explorations concerning slaves&#39; legal actions in the Americas.",72,HIST 2707,13381

Cultural Evolution,"Unlike other species, humans are heavily reliant on learning from others to acquire many important aspects of their behavior, and this cultural transmission has created a second system of inheritance that has driven much of our species&#39; genetic evolution. In addition to having shaped our species&#39; anatomy and physiology, cultural evolution has important implications for understanding human nature, and for how to tackle basic problems in psychology, economics and anthropology. The first third of this course will develop the basic principles and lines of inquiry while the remainder will apply, hone and refine them by exploring economic development, the history of modern institutions, and global inequality.",78,HEB 1290,13406
Evolutionary Origins of the Human Mind,"Human behavior is strikingly different from other animals: we speak languages, create tools, work together on large-scale endeavors, and even learn from others in university classrooms. What cognitive processes underlie these behaviors, and how did they emerge? In this course, we will examine the evolutionary origins of human cognition, with an eye to identifying what human psychological capacities are unique versus shared with other species.&nbsp; To do so, we will integrate theoretical perspectives from biology concerning the evolution of intelligent behavior, with current empirical research from comparative psychology. Topics will include: social cognition, communication, inhibitory control, and memory and planning, with a focus on humans and other primates.",78,HEB 1300,13519
Afro-Latin America: History and Culture,"This course explores how African cultural expressions influenced colonial societies and later national cultures in Latin America. How did peoples of African descent shape the formation of Latin American national cultures in areas such as literature, religion, visual arts, music, dance, and cinema? Some scholars have debated whether African religious, musical, medical and communitarian practices were reproduced in the New World or whether they were creolized through fusion with other (European and indigenous) practices. Others have sought to explain how African cultural practices (music, religion, dances) that were derided as primitive and uncivilized in the early twentieth century became &quot;nationalized&quot; and transformed into key expressions of national cultures in many Latin American countries. What are the implications of this process for those cultural forms and their practitioners? How do they impact, if at all, other areas of social life?Ã_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÃ_ We explore these questions through historical and literary texts, films, visual arts, and recordings.",1,AFRAMER 124Y,13708

Geometry of Algebraic Curves,"Algebraic curves are some of the most fascinating objects in algebraic geometry: we know a good deal about them, but many major open questions remain.&nbsp; At the heart of these questions is the relation between the classical notion of curves in projective space and the modern notion of abstract curves. The theory of linear systems on curves, which we&#39;ll study in this course, represents a bridge between these two notions. We&#39;ll cover the basic theorems governing linear systems on curves (Riemann-Roch, Clifford&#39;s theorem, etc.) and go on to discuss the Castelnuovo and Brill-Noether theorems, ending with a survey of open problems (and what we know about them so far).",81,MATH 282,13117
Contact Homology,"The purpose of this course is to introduce some invariants of contact manifolds that are defined by counting pseudolomorphic curves, and discuss some applications. We will also discuss some related invariants of symplectic manifolds. The particular invariants we will discuss will be chosen in part based on audience input; an emphasis of the course will be a recently developed invariant called embedded contact homology, and other topics may include cylindrical and linearized contact homology, Legendrian contact homology, the contact homology algebra, symplectic homology, and symplectic field theory. Some of these invariants have yet to be rigorously defined, and part of the course will involve explaining some of the issues that remain to be resolved, and some possible approaches.&nbsp; Applications will include generalizations of the Weinstein conjecture, symplectic embedding problems, distinguishing contact structures, and calculating Gromov-Witten invariants by cutting along contact-type hypersurfaces.",81,MATH 287,13547

St. Louis from Lewis and Clark to Michael Brown,"St. Louis was the epicenter of American empire in the nineteenth century: the point of embarkation for Lewis and Clark; the military headquarters for U.S. Indian wars.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was likewise central to the history of slavery: from the Missouri Compromise to Dred Scott.&nbsp; The city&rsquo;s intertwining of the history of empire and race continued through the twentieth century in its prominent role in the defense industry as well as the history of segregation, urban &ldquo;redevelopment,&rdquo; and police violence. How does the global capitalist and imperialist history of St. Louis relate to its recalcitrant inequality, structural racism, and endemic violence?",72,HIST 13C,13089
"Literatur, Theorie, Wissen: E.T.A. Hoffmann","\tExplores the fascinating &oelig;uvre of E.T.A. Hoffmann, using it as a case study for applying literary theories, on the one hand, and for investigating the history of knowledge (Wissensgeschichte), on the other.

Robert Musil: Seminar,"Alongside his shorter narrative works, the seminar will focus on Musil&rsquo;s famous novel Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (1930-1942). At issue is his incorporation of contemporary science, philosophy, and psychology (as well as personal experiences) into his creative work, establishing a new form of &ldquo;essayistic&rdquo; fiction.Readings in German, discussion in English&nbsp;",65,GERMAN 243,13090
History of Human Rights,"\tIs morality found or made? Every belief comes from someplace and somewhere, but we rarely think this affects its truth. Is morality neatly separable from the pathways and contexts thanks to which it comes to our attention? Taking contemporary human rights norms, laws, and movements as a case study, this course examines this question. We will study where human rights norms come from, the history of international organizations, and how non-governmental actors came to defend human rights. The relationship of human rights to the histories of governance, empire, warfare, emotions, and victimhood will be taken up.",60,ETHRSON 40,12936

Literature and Social History: A View from Brazil,"The objective of this course is to study major authors and works of nineteenth-century Brazilian fiction. Writing fiction from a spot deemed to be in the &ldquo;periphery&rdquo; of the western world meant a difficult and complex engagement with European literary and intellectual traditions. The course will focus primarily on the evidence regarding changes in the politics of social dominance in the period &ndash;from slavery and paternalism to the worlds and meanings of &ldquo;free&rdquo; labor. Questions of class, gender and race in the general context of defining and setting new limits of citizenship rights will be emphasized.",72,HIST 1930,13415
"Slavery, Disease and Race: A View from Brazil","Slavery and emancipation were major issues in nineteenth-century Brazilian history. In the 1870&rsquo;s and 1880&rsquo;s, with the drama of emancipation unfolding, yellow fever meant death to European immigrants and a major obstacle to achieving a social configuration that valued the whitening ideal and excluded people of African descent from social and economic opportunities. Although the primary focus of this course is Brazil, students may opt to write a final paper that compares an aspect of the social history of slavery and/or race and/or disease in Brazil and another nation or region. Class materials will include a range of primary sources.",72,HIST 1931,13639
Topics on Geometric Analysis,We shall cover topics related to existence and regularity for nonlinear equations appearing in Kahler geometry and general relativity.,81,MATH 289,13306
Ethical Problems in 18th-Century Literature,"How does what we read change us? Can literature help readers to confront their prejudices and improve their knowledge? Can it assist in recognizing and responding to the suffering of others? The eighteenth century took seriously the idea that literature and the arts could encourage wisdom and shape better citizens. Over the period, numerous intellectuals, from British poets to French philosophes, waged and increasingly vigorous debate over the pedagogic and didactic functions of literature. We will pay special attention to the conceptual and rhetorical tools by which authors sought to inculcate certain values in their readers. Authors may include Bunyan, Dryden, Richardson, Johnson, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, and Edgeworth.",52,ENGLISH 144M,13334
World Theater,"This course will examine theatrical forms and practices developed in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, as well as modern and contemporary intercultural performances.

Poetry of the Long 18th Century,"An introduction to reading poetry, by means of the wide variety of verse written in Britain during the long eighteenth century. We will begin with Milton&rsquo;s Paradise Lost, then turn to lofty hymns, vicious satires, and lyrics of startling beauty. In addition to familiarizing students with the forms, techniques, and themes of poetry in English, this course will involve substantial use of the treasures in Houghton Library, and it will emphasize the communal aspect of reading poems: students will gather in small groups each week to read aloud to each other. Poets include Dryden, Pope, Barbauld, Blake, Wordsworth, and Keats.",52,ENGLISH 50A,13829
The Literature of Empire,"This course investigates how writers in the English-speaking world represented race, nation, and empire at a time when these categories were being renegotiated. We will read a wide range of authors from Britain, the US, the Caribbean, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, including Kipling, Forster, Twain, Du Bois, Plaatje, Kincaid, and Ishiguro. We will ask: how do national and imperial imaginaries differ? How did minority writers manipulate narratives of empire to gain recognition as citizens?",52,ENGLISH 61A,13832
Methods for Quantitative Data Analysis,"This course reviews several of the core methods for analyzing data: data visualization and statistical graphics, simple programming with data, studying data dispersion, statistical inference under model uncertainty and related topics. The lectures will examine the real-world challenges of data analysis and explore how statistical methods can be used to learn from data, and draw valid statistical inferences. &nbsp;The approach will be heavily applied involving data analysis with Stata and R. Students will develop their own empirical projects applying the methods from the course.",137,SOCIOL 218,13823
Arab-Israeli Conflict,"In this course, we will examine the several dimensions and levels (domestic, international) of the ongoing crisis in, around, and about Israel/Palestine.&nbsp; In what ways is the Arab-Israeli conflict central to broader political patterns in the region, and why has it proven so intractable?&nbsp; How have the various parties to the conflict defined its stakes, understood their interests, viewed their adversaries, mobilized support, and formulated policy?&nbsp; What possibilities does the future hold?",70,GOV 1219,13126

Stoicism: Proseminar,"Stoicism was by far the most systematic and influential of the philosophical schools that arose in the &lsquo;Hellenistic&rsquo; period between the death of Aristotle (322 BCE) and the end of the Roman republic (31 BCE); its significance as a tradition in ancient philosophy is second only to that of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, with which it is to some extent continuous. The writings of the Greek founders, starting with Zeno of Citium in the early third century BCE, now exist only in quotations and paraphrases in later authors, but Roman Stoicism is well attested in complete surviving works of Cicero, Seneca and others. A version of Stoic ethics became something of a default guide to life for generations of well-born Romans.In this course we will read the main surviving texts of Stoicism, and examine Stoic ideas under the three headings of physics/metaphysics, ethics and logic. The Stoics developed the first detailed and systematic account of nature that can be thought of as materialist, and the first such account of ethics based on the idea of natural law. They also made the first and perhaps only significant advances in logic between Aristotle and the Middle Ages.",122,PHIL 105,13333
Drawing on Exhibition,"Course designed in preparation for a curricular exhibition of 18th &amp;19th-century drawings to take place at Harvard Art Museums involving students.

Buddhist Philosophy: Proseminar,"Selected topics in Buddhist epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind. Special attention will be given to arguments that Buddhist philosophers used to defend their views and respond to their critics. In addition to understanding these arguments in their historical contexts, we will ask what we can learn from them today and, when relevant, investigate how they are being used in contemporary philosophy.",122,PHIL 192,13088
Philosophy and Photography: Proseminar,"The seminar will examine the nature of photography and what makes it distinctive as a form of visual representation.&nbsp; Topics include the nature of photographic &#39;realism&#39;, the difference between mechanical and &#39;hand-made&#39; images, and how these differences matter both epistemically and to our aesthetic, moral, and psychological responses to them.&nbsp; Readings will be taken from writers such as Barthes, Bazin, Benjamin, Berger, Cavell, Sontag and others.",122,PHIL 187A,13340
From Gospel to Allegory: Christian Narratives for Living,"The original form for teaching Christians how to live was not law but biography. Imitating the Gospels, many Christian writers have offered their most important teachings as narrations. They have held up holy lives as examples or displayed wicked lives as warnings. They have tried to tell their own lives in confession or to imagine alternate lives as allegory or prophecy. Always eager to move from word to action, Christian writers have tried above all to reshape lives, especially by projecting new communities and rituals. This course will consider a wide range of works from gospels to medieval allegories by authors as diverse as Athanasius or Augustine and Margery Kempe.",160,RELIGION 49,13371
Religious Diversity and The Age of Pluralism,"How has the diversity of religion in today&#39;s world brought new challenges to nations, societies, and communities?&nbsp; How has religious diversity given rise to new theological and spiritual perspectives within each religious tradition? What does interfaith mean in the many contexts of human life and faith today? We will look at both civic and religious perspectives on the problems of religious difference, considering major writings on the meanings and regimes of religious pluralism in the U.S., Europe, and India.",160,RELIGION 1021,13310
Got (New) Brain? The Evolution of Brain Regeneration,"This course will cover concepts and theories on evolutionary changes in nervous system regenerative capacity of different organisms. Material will be taught in a dynamic setting combining lectures and brainstorming of the literature with hands-on experience in the laboratory.

Augustine's Confessions,"The aim of this course is to introduce students to the Confessions of Augustine of Hippo, a Christian theologian of the 4th/5th c. This seminar will introduce students to the life of Augustine, but will focus on a close reading of the Confessions in English translation, attending to such questions as: what is a &quot;confession&quot; and how does it relate to autobiography?&nbsp; Who is the &quot;I&quot; that speaks and the &quot;you&quot; to whom it speaks, and what is the condition of that speech? How are we best to understand this text, as a work of theology, philosophy, or literature (or is that division even helpful)?",160,RELIGION 44,13656
Languages of the Caucasus,"This course pursues two related goals: to introduce the students to the empirical complexity of languages of the Caucasus and to discuss theoretical analyses in phonology, morphology, and syntax motivated by these languages. The course involves a subsidiary field methods component, with students working with a native speaker in class, learning ways to elicit complex data from a little known language.",80,LING 149,13279

Students will be involved in the creation of a museum exhibit based on artifacts from Harvard Museums.",56,FRSEMR 40C,13793
Waste: Contemporary Fictions of Abjection,"This seminar will examine contemporary novels concerned with the relationship between the environmental and psychic management of material waste, and the formation of outcast communities. We will explore how and why these novels link trash and decay with processes of social exclusion. &nbsp;By studying novels alongside related films, images, and essays, we will consider the place of waste in contemporary culture and ask what fiction, in particular, can contribute to discussions about trash, ecological disasters, and marginalized communities.",56,FRSEMR 30D,13050
Modern Civilization and the Rise of Heart Disease,"Heart diseases have plagued humans since ancient times, but only in the past century has heart disease become epidemic throughout the world. Despite great progress in prevention and therapy, heart diseases will be major causes of death and disability throughout the next century. Modernization of civilization has played a major role in the rise of heart disease. Conversely, advances in heart disease have powerfully changed society and our personal daily behavior. In this seminar, we will examine some of the major intersection events between heart disease and modern society over the past century and consider how this could change the next century in America and throughout the world. The topics include highly visible events such as the deaths of American Presidents from cardiovascular disease, leading to the rise of biomedical research in the US, as well as relatively obscure events like a young physician inserting a urinary drainage tube into his heart&mdash;ultimately generating the modern life-saving treatment for heart attacks. We will explore how major lifestyle factors such as tobacco, alcohol, exercise and diet affect health, and how economics and politics often play a role in the complex relationship of health and society. In addition, we will visit a high technology modern cardiology facility and watch some technology in action.",56,FRSEMR 21H,13329
Taxi Driver and/in American Film History,"A key work of the modern American cinema, Martin Scorsese&#39;s TAXI DRIVER will be closely examined from a variety of approaches: &nbsp;in terms of film history, both US and international; in relation to genre; with regards to the historical moment of its release, especially the end of the Vietnam War; in connection with parallel movements in the visual arts, such as photo-realism. &nbsp;The seminar will work together to prepare a highly detailed, shot-by-shot breakdown and analysis of the film.",56,FRSEMR 30F,13038
Fictions of War,"This seminar will focus on landmark works of fiction (in English) that grapple with&nbsp; individual experiences and social consequences of major wars involving the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Military confrontations are immensely destructive but, as human enterprises, they also produce culture.&nbsp; The seminar will investigate how modern soldiers have represented the aims and outcomes of the field of war in fiction.&nbsp; More inclusively, it will examine both the intentional and unintentional cultural work of war. The seminar&#39;s title is deliberately ambiguous, also allowing for the implication that nations construct fictions about aims or enemies in order to galvanize their people to wage war.",56,FRSEMR 30C,13057
Living on the edge: imagining the unknown in ancient ethnography,"This course explores how ancient Greeks and Romans thought about the edges of the known world. We will examine ancient accounts and images of people, cultural practices, and geography at the margins of western experience, and try to understand how such stories developed. Topics include maps, ethnocentrism, Orientalism, Roman triumphal processions, and science fiction. Our discussions will regularly draw on comparable ways of constructing the unknown in modern American culture.",56,FRSEMR 30H,13051
Performing French Theater Across Time and Media,"This seminar aims to help students, including those who are genuine novices in acting, to understand and experience theater as a form of physical expression that evolve as aesthetic and social contexts change across time. Readings include the most famous French playwrights of both the early modern age (Moli&egrave;re, Corneille, Racine) and the later twentieth / early twenty-first centuries. Special emphasis is paid the transformative power of performance and the development of the students&rsquo; acting skills through practical workshops and videos of recent productions. The final project consists of an excerpt to be performed in French or bilingual format.",56,FRSEMR 30R,13080
"Food, Climate, and Data","We will explore the implications of interacting trends in population, diet, and climate for food security.&nbsp; The course begins with some background literature on food security, initially juxtaposing Malthus and Boserup, and then moving to Sen.&nbsp; The primary focus, however, is a data-driven exploration of food security through analysis of weather, climate, demographics, and yield.&nbsp; Specific questions that we will empirically address are how temperature and precipitation influence yield outcomes?&nbsp; Can agriculture be adapted to a changed climate?&nbsp; How will demographics and diet shift in the coming decades?&nbsp; Will the green revolution continue to yield steady increases?&nbsp; And can we predict famine?",56,FRSEMR 21D,13305
Medical Technologies in Historical Perspective,"The course examines the ways in which various medical technologies shaped and were shaped by physician and nurse practices and goals as well as ideas about patient care in American medicine from the 19th-century to the present. We will look at how the meanings attached to medical technologies grew out of specific historical, social, political and medical contexts. Medical technologies examined include: imaging machines; clinical, diagnostic and genetic tests; reproductive technologies; and artificial organs.",76,HISTSCI 144,13018
Introduction to Buddhism,"A study of the major themes of Buddhist thought and practice, beginning with the origins of the tradition in India and exploring the transmission and development of the tradition in Southeast Asia, Tibet, East Asia, and the modern West. Important themes include the concepts of reincarnation, karma, and nirvana; the legend of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama; the nature of the self; the education of the emotions; and the possibility of liberation. The course will focus on scriptural, literary, and philosophical classics of Buddhist tradition, but it will also consider the tradition of Buddhist art and the formative rituals in Buddhist life, such as meditation, pilgrimage, and monastic discipline.&nbsp;Throughout the course we will consider the relevance of this material to our own views of the world and how we should lead our lives. Note that the course has additional section hour to be arranged.",160,RELIGION 74,13028
The Christian Bible Then and Now: Formations and Debates,"Politicians, writers, religious leaders, and others today make arguments using the Bible, whether leading with the clause &ldquo;The Bible says. . .&rdquo; or through allusions to or quotations of the Bible. Together in this seminar we&rsquo;ll learn and practice the analytical tools for addressing such claims. The seminar explores ancient and modern formations and uses of the Christian Bible, including ancient processes of canonization. It also explores how the Bible has been mobilized recently in the U.S. to address issues of sex and sexuality, economics, ecology, race, and slavery.",56,FRSEMR 32C,13286
Happiness,"What is happiness?&nbsp; To what extent is our own happiness under our control, and what are the causes and consequences of happiness?&nbsp; Is happiness important for living a good and successful life?&nbsp; How does the pursuit of personal happiness interact with our obligations to others?&nbsp; In this seminar we will work toward answering these and other questions by analyzing recent work from both philosophy and psychology.&nbsp; Our goal is to construct a unified picture of happiness that incorporates what is best from both disciplines but appropriately takes into account various challenges that each has posed for the other.",56,FRSEMR 31H,13045
Gregorian Chant,"Introduction to medieval chant. Medieval Latin church music, usually called Gregorian Chant, is the oldest surviving repertory of music in western culture, and is still sung today. We will consider the function of chant in medieval society, and the role of chant in ritual and liturgy. Members of the seminar will be expected to sing, but no previous experience or knowledge of notation is required. We will examine manuscript in the Houghton Library. We will study the musical aspects of a few pieces in great detail, and will come to know the great variety and artistry of this timeless repertory.",56,FRSEMR 31L,13053
Guilty until Proven Innocent. Finding Justice and Truth in the Middle Ages,"Diving into the world of medieval law and rituality, students will discover the &ldquo;Real Game of Thrones&rdquo;. We are going to explore concepts of justice and law, encompassing the first written laws from the time of the so-called Barbarian Invasions, Church law, and reminiscences of pre-Christian rituals. The place of the divine in search of truth and justice, of women in a male-dominated culture, of Jews in a world ruled by Christian sovereigns will be analyzed in particular. Students will work with primary sources in order to elucidate the ways in which truth and justice were searched and established.",56,FRSEMR 31R,13857
"Sex, Technology, and Trump: What Lies Ahead for The Constitution","Donald Trump&rsquo;s unexpected victory on November 8th represents a seismic shift that may soon affect&mdash;even during this semester&mdash;subjects including separation of powers, federalism, immigration, corruption, religious freedom, and freedom of speech: in short, all things constitutional. Yet, as unpredictable as the future may be, the decisions of the executive branch and the electorate remain constrained, at least in theory, by a legal system built on a Constitution that emerged from the social and political conflicts of eras long past. Students entering the Class of 2020 weren&rsquo;t alive when civilization-ending military conflagration seemed a real possibility, or when an American president was driven from office because of a scandal linked to hacking the opposing candidate&rsquo;s private information. Today&rsquo;s students cannot easily recall a time before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the global responses they triggered. Nor can they imagine a world before the internet, social media, and interactive videogames, a world not immersed in images of sex and violence&mdash;a time more innocent, perhaps, yet in many ways more repressive. Social and cultural revolutions have upended the pace of political upheaval and conventional understandings of family, sexuality, and intimacy. Economic dislocation and a sense of exclusion have disrupted partisan affiliations. Scientific revolutions and technological innovations have provided new opportunities for communication and connection even as they have created new mechanisms for surveillance, profiling and control&mdash;at once improving democratic accountability and yet strengthening the state&rsquo;s grip and the prospects for tyranny. Adapting the words of this Constitution and the values it embodies requires analyzing the blend of politics and law practiced in and by the United States Supreme Court and influenced by popular culture and political discourse. This seminar, drawing on judicial opinions and secondary sources, will explore how our most basic legal framework, that of the U.S. Constitution and the law surrounding its interpretation and implementation, shapes and is shaped by modern forces battling for the character of the national soul.",56,FRSEMR 40F,13806
Personal Agency and Social Networks,"The study of social networks is vast, involving everything from the structure of ties among Facebook friends to the process through which people decide whom to ask for help. In spite of the popularity of social media and recent attention to network data by businesses, the study of networks has a long- standing history, with important contributions by anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists dating back to as early as the 1930s. This course examines two questions in that vast body of work&mdash;how people&rsquo;s behavior is affected by their networks and how they make decisions about how to use their networks.",56,FRSEMR 40R,13856
Animals and Ethics,"Do human beings have moral obligations to the other animals? If so, what are they, and why?&nbsp; Should or could non-human animals have legal rights? Should we treat wild and domestic animals differently? Do human beings have the right to eat the other animals, raise them for that purpose on factory farms, use them in experiments, display them in zoos and circuses, make them race or fight for our entertainment, make them work for us, and keep them as pets? We will examine the work of utilitarian, Kantian, and Aristotelian philosophers, and others who have tried to answer these questions.",122,PHIL 174A,13295
Well-Being,"What makes someone&#39;s life go well? Is it pleasure, desire, satisfaction, or something else? How should questions of well-being bear on one&#39;s reasoning about what to do, and on one&#39;s relations with other people? Can you assess your well-being by evaluating parts of your life individually, or does it depend on the shape of your life as a whole? Readings will include work by Richard Kraut, Derek Parfit, T. M. Scanlon, J. David Velleman, and Susan Wolf, among others.",122,PHIL 171,13871
Love and Inner Conflict,"The most important feature distinguishing human beings from other animals is generally supposed to be a capacity for reasoning &ndash; about how things are, but also about what to do. It is clear, however, that no account of intentional human action that restricts itself to reasoning will be adequate. Much of what we do seems to be the outcome of some kind of inner struggle or conflict about what to do, or (in the more momentous cases) which path in life to follow, and sometimes we act in ways we know to be &lsquo;contrary to reason&rsquo;. It is not at all clear what&rsquo;s really going on when this happens.Plato (428-348 BCE), Augustine (354-430 CE) and Freud (1856-1939) offer especially interesting and plausible accounts of such inner conflict. In their different ways, they each understood such conflict in terms of the soul&rsquo;s having parts, or distinct faculties. They are also alike in positing a fundamental but highly plastic force in the soul, in terms of which its development or deformation, including its division into parts, can be understood. They all called this force love, although it is not straightforward what they meant, or whether they meant the same thing, by calling it that.In this course, we will look at these theories of the composite, love-driven psyche as expressed in various of their works, such as Plato&rsquo;s Gorgias, Symposium and Republic, Augustine&rsquo;s Confessions and De Trinitate, and Freud&rsquo;s The Interpretation of Dreams and The Ego and the Id. The aim is to achieve some understanding, not only of the theories, but also of the phenomena they are theories of.",122,PHIL 21,13349
Self-Consciousness and Self Knowledge: Proseminar,"Many of the most interesting and puzzling features of the mind are connected with the fact that each of us seems to have a special perspective on his or her own mind, a perspective that gives us a distinctive awareness of ourselves &ldquo;as subject, not mere object&rdquo; and a distinctive knowledge of our own mental lives &ldquo;from the first person perspective&rdquo;.&nbsp; We will consider the nature of such self-consciousness and self-knowledge, and also some striking ways in which we can be unknown to ourselves.",122,PHIL 158X,13833
Responsibility,"Forms of responsibility, and various views of the conditions under which a person can be responsible in these ways.",122,PHIL 178S,13835
Religious Liberty: Contested American Stories,"This course considers the long history of the United States&#39; engagement with the ideal of religious liberty. From the Puritans&#39; conception of liberty as the freedom to hold correct beliefs, through Native American efforts to preserve sacred practices, to the current debates over the philosophical impossibility of true religious equality and over the &quot;religious freedom restoration acts&quot; emerging in various states, the course will move across the full sweep of American history on the topic. It examines both the structural relationship of church and state - at the federal and local levels - as well as more diffuse cultural attitudes. It combines scholarly literature, primary sources and students&#39; original research.",160,RELIGION 51,13307
The Body in Christian Thought,"The course offers an introduction to Christian ideas about the body, by considering central teachings and areas of debate&lsaquo;including understandings of creation, incarnation, healing, and resurrection. Texts include early Christian literatures, Patristic and medieval texts, Reformation theologies, as well as modern and contemporary authors. The course will help students understand the distinctiveness and diversity of Christian positions on these topics.",160,RELIGION 58,13040
Beginnings: Prefaces and Exordiums in Classical Persian Literature,"Readings from major Persian poetic and prose works from the 10th to the 15th century, with a focus on prefaces and exordiums. Spanning across genres, from epic, lyric and narrative verse to didactic andarz, scientific treatise and historiography, the course will explore the various possible openings of classical Persian texts and survey the functions and techniques of literary thresholds. Authors will include FerdowsÃ_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂ‚, KeykaÃ_Â€ÂÅÃçÃ_Â‰Ã_Ã__vuÃ_Â€ÂÅÃçÃ_Â‰Ã_Ã__s, NeÃ_Â€ÂŒÃ§Ã_Â‰ÂŒ_Ã_Â‰Ã_Ã_Ã¬Ã_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂÅmÃ_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂ‚, JoveyniÃ_Â€ÂÅÃçÃ_Â‰Ã_Ã__, RÃ_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂ‚mÃ_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂ‚ and JÃ_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂÅmÃ_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂ‚.",115,PERSIAN 155,13138
Classical Persian Poetics and Rhetoric,"This course explores the development of Persian literary theory from the 11th&nbsp;century onwards, with readings from the major authors who shaped the technical (Raduyani, Rasid al-Din Vatvat, Sams-e Qeys-e Razi, Hoseyn Vaez-e Kasefi), didactic (Keykavus, Nezami Arudi) and philosophical (Nasir al-Din Tusi, Jami) trends in classical literary scholarship. Students will become acquainted with the tools and concepts of literary analysis developed in pre-modern Iran and exert their skills through the practice of close reading and discussion of select literary material.",115,PERSIAN 251,13339
Drawing Room: Space as Framework,"This studio course aims to further basic drawing skills with intention and purpose while expanding how we see the world around us.&nbsp;Using&nbsp;conventional drawing methods as a starting point, we will explore the potential of depicting&nbsp;space,&nbsp;both literally and metaphorically. Examining landscape, objects, buildings and interiors, students are encouraged to consider their relationship to the physical, conceptual and emotional spaces they inhabit. Finding&nbsp;inspiration from both contemporary art practices and architecture itself, assignments will delve into abstract and conceptual principles, and introduce specialized systems of rendering and notation.&nbsp;",162,VES 11A,13342
Sweet and Sour: A Taste of Persian Literary and Visual Culture,"Introduction to some of the most significant aspects of Persian Culture, explored through the notion of &ldquo;sweet-and-sour&rdquo; (torsh-o shirin). Borrowed from the realm of food and cookery, the idiom refers to a dominant flavor in Persian cuisine. Yet, it may also express the conflicting nature of human experience or the savory contrasts at play in works of art and craft. This course examines the paradigm of taste and its role as an aesthetic and anthropological criterion in pre-modern and modern Persian culture. From the pickles market in Hamadan and Avicenna&rsquo;s Canon of Medicine to Nezami&rsquo;s romance Khosrow-o Shirin and Abbas Kiarostami&rsquo;s Taste of Cherry, we will survey a wide array of material from literature, iconography, cinema and the culinary arts.",115,PERSIAN 165,13830
Modern Persian Poetry and Prose,The course focuses on the reading and understanding of a selection of texts from various genres within the corpus of modern Persian poetry and prose. Students will become acquainted with the major actors of the early Iranian literary modernity (late 19th - early 20th century) through a selection of excerpts drawn from their literary as well as theoretical output. The detailed understanding of the language at play among Iranian modernists will complement the study of the context and literary significance of these texts.,115,PERSIAN 158,13827
"Persuasive Projections: Film, Video, and Moving-Image Installation","This is an introductory course in experimental video and film art, as well as forms of installation that incorporate the moving image. Screenings will include works by Andy Warhol, Bruce Nauman, and Yvonne Rainer, as well as hand-made animation and non-art sources such as film noir and television; all types of moving-image media will be part of the class&rsquo;s expanding brainstorm. Students will create individual projects that develop skills in lighting, camera, editing, and sound.",162,VES 67R,13029
New Waves,"This studio course invites students to create projects using new genres media such as film, video, installation, performance, actions, time, protest, and other nontraditional processes. Projects using materials such as printmaking and sculpture are also encouraged. We will develop individual projects through discussions, arguments, visiting artists, and field trips. A history of conceptual and performance art from 1950-present will be traced. The goal is to emphasize the development of artistic ideas by broadening and challenging students&rsquo; investigations.",162,VES 137,13831
Introduction to Political Sociology,"Politics is about power and authority. But the production, conservation and distribution of power and authority occur far beyond Capitol Hill: in family dynamics, neighborhood residential patterns, racial discrimination, welfare policies, social movements, nation-states and the globalized economy. So how is power exerted? Where is it, and how is it gained and lost? How do power centers get challenged? In this course, we examine such questions using the conceptual framework and analytic tools of political sociology. Major themes will include the nation-state and its challengers, capitalism, democracy, and globalization. Abstract, theoretical works are explored with practical applications and illustrations in specific national/historical contexts. Students will also become aware of criticisms and debates in political sociology &ndash; as well as its limitations.",137,SOCIOL 23,13077
Ancient Christian Martyrdom and Its Modern Legacy,"The varied ways in which ancient Christians represented persecution in the Roman empire has left a rich and sometimes troubling legacy for the modern world. Their struggles are documented in stories of torture and public execution, revelations from God, treatise exhorting believers to confess, and polemics against fellow Christians who thought otherwise. Some advocated suffering and demonized their opponents, others ascetic withdrawal, pacifism, silent endurance, or even living well as the best witness to God. In the aftermath, they agonized over how to heal traumatized communities. This course will examine this literature and its legacy for contemporary issues such religious (in)tolerance, torture, and what it means to be fully human.",160,RELIGION 441,13058
American Economic Fictions,"This course considers the culture of American capitalism through an examination of a range of literary and historical texts.&nbsp; As we explore the shifts in thinking about class, labor, business, and money from the early days of the republic through the present, we will ask how a wide variety of cultural producers engage with and critique economic thought.",73,HIST-LIT 90BK,13122
American Memorials from Slavery to September 11,"This course will investigate the role memorials play in society and examine the politics of memory in order to better understand the dynamic nature of creating meaning in the past and present from American monuments. We will broaden our conception of monuments beyond stone statues to include museums, national parks, music, art, film and the web. Movies and viewings of local memorials will supplement our seminar experience.",73,HIST-LIT 90BL,13046
Sports and Empire,"Why do American sports differ from the rest of the world?&nbsp; How did soccer become a global sport?&nbsp; What explains the distribution of cricket and rugby around the world?&nbsp; Are sports a form of cultural imperialism?&nbsp; This course will explore these questions (and more) as we examine the connection between sports and imperialism.&nbsp; Themes we will cover include race, class, gender, professionalism, and commercialization.&nbsp; Readings include rule books, novels, poems, periodicals, memoirs, and films.",73,HIST-LIT 90BO,13266
"National Bodies, Public Health","This course explores the relations among health, the body, and the US nation at the turn of the twentieth century. These years witnessed profound transformations in the national economy and international politics; in debates about the meanings of race, class, and gender; and in shifting understandings of health and disease. Against this backdrop, we will draw on readings from across the disciplines to ask how biological, social, and cultural ideas about bodies became central to US national identity.",73,HIST-LIT 90BP,13073
Early Modern Encounters,"This course explores the dynamic and diverse movement of people, texts, ideas, and objects across the world during the early modern period (1300-1800). Each week approaches global exchanges through a case study of a local cross-cultural encounter from the Americas and Asia to Africa and Europe. The course will examine diverse topics like the Renaissance, Confucianism, the Age of Discovery and art, material culture, cosmopolitanism and travel, Islamic music, and the environment from historical, literary, and digital perspectives.",73,HIST-LIT 90BQ,13120
Cultures of Commodity Production Across the Americas,"This seminar uses social and cultural approaches to explore the history of Latin American and Caribbean commodity production, from silver to cocaine. Drawing on historical texts, poetry, fiction, and film (all translated into English), we will study the communities created by those who mined, planted, harvested, and labored in the region&rsquo;s major export industries. This course challenges us to consider the socio-cultural implications of wider economic and trade processes.",73,HIST-LIT 90BR,13626
We Are the World,"How did we come to think that everybody living everywhere might count as our fellow citizens? Since 1989, a long-term canon in philosophy has emerged, casting &ldquo;cosmopolitanism&rdquo; as long-brewing since the time of the Greeks, running through Immanuel Kant, into our own day, as a new theory called &ldquo;global justice&rdquo; prevailed. We will revisit this canon as intellectual historians, attempting to reconcile it with how sudden the turn to global justice in our own age of globalization and human rights has been, and how the specter of power has always haunted the most grandiose moral visions.",56,FRSEMR 32D,13650
German Literature and Philosophy,"In this seminar students are introduced to exemplary works of philosophy and literature in the German tradition across 200 years of revolutions, wars, and social crises. Focus is on the significance of human life, desire, and knowledge, on the limits of abstraction and the infinite nuances of individual love, passion and anxiety. Participants will acquire skills in literary interpretation and philosophical argumentation, while becoming intimately familiar with shifting historical, social and cultural contexts. Above all, the seminar will teach students how to formulate innovative, probing, and fruitful questions, and thereby impart a capacity to engage critically with masterful texts.",56,FRSEMR 32F,13037
The <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus,"The seminar will focus on the Annals in their historiographical, stylistic, narratological, and ideological contexts.",153,CLASPHIL 232,13085
Feuding and Peacemaking in Viking Age Iceland (c.870 to c.1150 C.E),"Settled primarily by people from the Scandinavian mainland, Viking Age Iceland (c.870 to c.1150 C.E.) was a stateless society with a highly sophisticated legal culture but without public officials to adjudicate disputes, enforce the law, or punish legal violations.&nbsp; The main sanctions against wrongdoing were monetary compensation, vengeance, feuding, and outlawry. To understand how this complex but unstable legal order was maintained and how competition for honor and power was kept within bounds, the seminar uses close readings, written analyses and class discussions of Icelandic family sagas, poems, historical narratives, and legal texts to study feuding and peacemaking, honor and shame, anger and hatred, kinship and marriage, gender, chieftaincy and clientage, gift-giving and plundering.&nbsp; It gives particular attention to the politics and group psychology of violent revenge and the roles of both men and women in containing it. By studying these topics in a medieval Icelandic context, the course also introduces students to subjects of ongoing research and controversy among historians of early Europe and to the social theories and paradigms that underlie their work.&nbsp; The course presupposes no previous knowledge of medieval history or literature.",56,FRSEMR 41F,13262
Oceans and Culture,"From the coasts of the Mediterranean to New England, from the islands of Oceania to the formerly vast British Empire, many cultures are shaped by the waters that surround them.&nbsp; Drawing on ethnographies of maritime cultures as well as historical accounts, literature, films, Harvard&rsquo;s museums and libraries (e.g., Peabody Museum, Map Library, Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments), and visits to the USS Constitution (&ldquo;Old Ironsides&rdquo;), the seminar explores how different cultures make use of the sea (and how maritime engagements shape cultures), through navigation, maritime exploration, cartography, fishing, trade, colonization, technologies of ship building, principles of maritime law, and naval power.",56,FRSEMR 41C,13631
European and American Pop Art 1955-1975,"The seminar will introduce undergraduate students to some of the key moments in the history of international Pop Art, from 1955-1975, from Richard Hamilton in Great Britain and the New Realists in Paris to Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol in New York and Ed Ruscha in Los Angeles. While the historical accounts of how a mass cultural iconography defined artistic production at that&nbsp;&nbsp; time will be the major project of the seminar, some of the key theoretical questions concerning the relationship between avant-garde and mass culture in the twentieth century will be addressed as well.",56,FRSEMR 32H,13027
Economic Justice,"Capitalism organizes society around individual pursuits of material gain. Capitalism seems to have won the great ideological struggle with other ways of organizing society. But there is much discontent: the Occupy Movement made clear that even Americans now care about excessive inequality, and many worry about the future in an increasingly economically divided society where access to technology richly rewards some to the exclusion of many others. Capitalism is also closely associated with what is arguably the biggest policy problem of the 21st century: climate change. So how can we justify capitalism? And what are feasible alternative ways of organizing society?",60,ETHRSON 41,13517
Research Workshop in American Politics,"A forum for the presentation and discussion of research in progress by graduate students (second year and above), faculty, and visiting scholars.

The Politics of the Environment in Asia,"Scholars have noted the connection between environment and specific forms of Asian politics and society. Today China reengineers the flow of its rivers to address social demands for water. South &amp; Southeast Asian polities realize how politics beyond their borders can determine the flow of the region&#39;s rivers--and thus the health of their societies. The dangers of poor air quality, polluted land, and contaminated food energize social movements and unrest.&nbsp; Asian development models have resulted in extreme pollution, and with resulting public health problems, governmental attention to the environment has increased. In this research seminar students will explore &quot;politics and environment&quot; in Asia, with some attention being given to the future.",136,SOC-STD 98OK,13035
Decolonizing Development in Africa,"This course asks how development has shaped decolonization on the African continent. &nbsp;We interrogate antinomies of African &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; and &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; that inform development processes and interventions, notably through legacies of liberal state-making, divisions of labor and economic value, and the management of impoverished populations. &nbsp;Rather than approaching these worlds as without history or innovation, the course tracks their complex interactions with new technologies and infrastructures of belonging, work, and identity. &nbsp;Through social theory and ethnography, we attend to the impact of post-colonial development in the making of the current world order. &nbsp;",136,SOC-STD 98OR,13068
Honest Lies and Deceptive Truths: Modernity and the Politics of Transparency,"The idea that transparency, or truth in politics, is both an unequivocally good objective, and an attainable one, is now commonplace. The modern period of political thought, by contrast, presents startlingly different evaluations of, and approaches to, transparency. &nbsp;Drawing on the work of Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau, this course explores the politics of verity and falsity as each relates to questions of 1) epistemology 2) methodology and 3) rhetoric. &nbsp;In so doing, the course offers a historical lens through which to reconsider, and potentially critique, contemporary notions of political transparency. &nbsp;",136,SOC-STD 98OS,13229
Poverty and Development in Latin America,"This course explores how development theories and practices have shaped history, politics, and the dynamics of everyday life in Latin America. We consider Latin America&rsquo;s colonial legacy, the effects of modernization and dependency theories, and ideals of democratic development. Coupling in-depth ethnographies with readings from development theorists, topics we cover include: systemic inequality, citizenship, indigenous rights, environmentalism, healthcare, microcredit, state violence and insecurity.&nbsp;",136,SOC-STD 98OT,13100
Riots and Uprisings,"This course examines the role of riots and uprisings in social, economic, and political change. &nbsp;Twenty-first century governance has been characterized by a fracturing of state sovereignty and economic crisis in many parts of the globe, which have given rise to new forms of collective action, configurations of labor, and understandings of the material world. &nbsp;We ask how activist networks, crowds, and insurgencies are reshaping long-standing distinctions between law and illegality, privacy and publicity, formal and informal markets, state and non-state spaces, especially under conditions of stark inequality. &nbsp;Through contemporary theory, ethnography, and digital media methods, we focus on unrest over health, safety, and the environment.",136,SOC-STD 98PA,13505
Global Slums,"This course investigates &ldquo;the slum&rdquo; as a social product, an icon of disorder, and a setting for diverse cultures and modes of sociality. By comparing ethnographic case studies of slums from around the world, we explore how slums emerge at the intersection of global inequalities, state planning, and the insurgent practices of the poor. Topics we cover include: rural-urban migration, spatial segregation, housing and infrastructure, informal markets, sustainability, and urban social movements.",136,SOC-STD 98PB,13486
Practicing Democracy,"Making democracy work requires an &ldquo;organized&rdquo; citizenry with power to assert its interests effectively. Yet US political participation declines, growing more unequal, as new democracies struggle to make citizen participation possible. Students learn to address public problems by organizing: developing leadership, building community, and mobilizing power. Our pedagogy links sociological, political science, and social psychology theory with democratic practice.",136,SOC-STD 68AB,13322

The Chinese Immigrant Experience in America,"Uses the history of Boston&rsquo;s Chinatown as a case study to examine the experiences of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. from the 1880s until the present. Employs historical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives to examine major themes related to the social and economic development of U.S. Chinatowns and Chinese immigrant communities throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. This course is an activity-based learning course, limited to students who are concurrently participating in a Harvard-affiliated service program in or around Boston&rsquo;s Chinatown. Class discussions and assignments will make active links with students&rsquo; service work.&nbsp;Open to students in all concentrations.",136,SOC-STD 68CT,13592
Authority and Disobedience,"This course examines the relationship between individuals and &lsquo;governing agencies&rsquo;&mdash;most prominently, the state&mdash;from an analytic political-theory perspective. The course is divided into two parts. Part I focuses on theories of legitimate political authority: it considers different answers to the question of what, if anything, grounds states&rsquo;&mdash;and similar entities&rsquo;&mdash;moral right to rule. Part II addresses the dilemmas raised by non-compliance with authority (topics covered might include civil disobedience, punishment, and revolution).",70,GOV 94AO,13267
"Border Politics: Migration, Detention, and Il/legality","This course dwells in under-explored border spaces such as airport waiting zones, undocumented crossings, cross-border protests, and detention centers. US borders with Canada and M&eacute;xico offer comparative platforms for discussion of border politics. Despite efforts to harmonize immigration and refugee/asylum policies, US residents and their neighbors to the north and south face distinct economic, cultural, historical, and political landscapes. Students will explore and interrogate border practices, policies, and struggles and debate contemporary migration politics.",70,GOV 94AM,13052
"The Evolutionary Transition From Dinosaurs To Birds: Fossils, Genomes and Behavior","The transition of dinosaurs to modern birds is one of the most rapidly advancing and increasingly complete records of evolutionary change in the vertebrate fossil record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally it is an excellent model for how science builds on incremental discoveries and undergoes paradigm shifts as new data are collected. We will explore the dinosaurian origins of modern birds through exploration of Harvard&#39;s excellent collections of dinosaur fossils, skeletons and specimens of extant birds, and focused readings and discussions. The goal will be to gain a greater appreciation of dinosaur diversity and to better understand the deep origins of modern bird adaptations.",56,FRSEMR 21R,13116
Islam in Black America,"Much of the study of black religion in the United States has focused on its Christian roots.&nbsp; And, while the predominant impulse of black religious expression in the American context came from Christian worshippers, Muslim adherents were among those first brought to America&rsquo;s shores under the force and violence of slavery.&nbsp; This course explores the history of Islam among African Americans from the ante-bellum period through the present.&nbsp; It looks at significant moments in the development and transformation of Islam in the US through what Sherman Jackson calls its three &ldquo;resurrections.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;",56,FRSEMR 41H,13075
Sick and Tired of being Sick and Tired: Health Disparities and African Americans,"Since the arrival of Africans from Africa to America, their health and health care has been a critical issue for the nation. From the era of slavery to the present, African Americans have been disproportionately burdened by disease and ill health. Health disparities are the &ldquo;inequalities that occur in the provision of healthcare and access to healthcare across different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups.&rdquo; This course examines this issue over the long time frame from the 17th century to the present.&nbsp; Currently, compared to the white population, African Americans are at an overall greater risk for many serious and life threatening diseases.&nbsp; This course will examine how these disparities emerged over time. It will explore the strategies and practices that African Americans employed to improve their health care. It will also examine, the ways that cities, states and the federal government supported or ignored the health of African Americans.",56,FRSEMR 41D,13131
Chance and the Pleasures of Probability,"Probability is a subject that grew up in gambling dens, and yet is most likely (!) the most important aspect of mathematics that will touch your life repeatedly - especially when you least expect it (!).Probabilistic thinking is qualitatively different from the determinism that is typically taught early on in the sciences and elsewhere and yet is much more natural in most situations associated with mundane activities in life. It is also often counter-intuitive - all this means is that we are innately not very good probabilistic thinkers, but clearly can train ourselves to do so.",56,FRSEMR 21Z,13024
Autobiography and Black Freedom Struggles,"This seminar introduces the main traditions of African American political thought and the history of the black fight for justice through the genre of autobiography. Students will read some classic autobiographies by African Americans (for example, those by Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, and Malcolm X), along with some lesser-known works (for instance, autobiographies by Ida B. Wells, Shirley Chisholm, and Amiri Baraka). They will discover how an influential set of black individuals, both men and women, came to political consciousness and participated in the collective struggle for justice in America. Students will reflect on these figures&rsquo; personal struggles to find meaning and solace under unjust conditions and to forge dignified modes of resistance. The seminar provides an opportunity to see how these personalities interpreted key events and periods in U.S. history&mdash;slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, the Jim Crow era, the two World Wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, and the post-industrial urban crisis&mdash;as social actors who participated and lived through them. Close attention will be paid to their engagement with and contributions to the political traditions of liberalism, conservatism, socialism, black nationalism, and feminism. And students will critically examine how these influential thinkers and activists understood ideals like freedom, equality, democracy, fairness, and tolerance.",56,FRSEMR 32R,13694
"Borges, Garcia Marquez, Bolano and Other Classics of Modern Latin American Literature","This course introduces students to some of the most important Latin American literary works produced during the twentieth century. We will explore the ways in which these novels, short-stories, essays and poems interrogate the historical traumas, political contexts and aesthetic potential of the region between 1920s and 1980s. We will shed light on their place in the historical and cultural formation of the literary canon, as well as on the concept of &lsquo;classic&rsquo;. The goal of this seminar is two-fold. On the one hand, it introduces students to the Latin American literary and critical tradition through some of the best and most interesting literary and critical works (each novel or grouping of short stories and poems are paired with an important critical essay that situates them historically and aesthetically). On the other, it provides them with the fundamental skills of literary analysis (close reading, conceptual and historical framing, continuities and discontinuities with the aesthetic tradition), and that is why I have selected a relatively small number of readings, in order to have time to work through them, discuss them and have some flexibility to extend the classes we dedicate to a given author when our discussions merit it.&nbsp;",56,FRSEMR 33C,13104
Media in American Politics,"This course considers the degree to which Americans&#39; political opinions and actions are influenced by the media as well as the influence of the media on public policy. Topics to be covered include the history of the mass media, recent trends in the media, theories of media effects, the implications for politics of changes in media (e.g., the rise of the Internet, social media and partisan media), the ways in which the news shapes the public&#39;s perceptions of the political world, campaign communication, how the media affect the manner in which public officials govern, and the general role of the media in the democratic process.",56,FRSEMR 41R,13047
Psychoactive Molecules from Babylon to Breaking Bad,"Psychoactive molecules change brain function in ways that result in altered perception, mood, or consciousness, and while &lsquo;psychoactive&rsquo; hints at something illicit, examples range from caffeine to cocaine.&nbsp; After an introductory session, the seminar series begins with two meetings focused on foundational principles of brain chemistry.&nbsp; Subsequent meetings address four important molecular families: opioids, molecules like heroin, codeine, and Oxycontin; cannabinoids, molecules like THC, the active ingredient in marijuana and anandamide, our body&rsquo;s version of THC; serotonin, a neurotransmitter regulated by antidepressants like Prozac, Cymbalta, Celexa, and Wellbutrin XL; and amphetamines, molecules like Albuterol, Adderall, XTC/Molly, and crystal meth.&nbsp; Our meetings will use case studies from recent newspaper, magazine, or popular science articles to explore larger questions about how these substances were discovered; how they alter our brain chemistry; how they are used, abused and viewed today; and what they have taught us about how our brains work.&nbsp; These explorations often lead to unexpected connections.&nbsp; For example the three seminars on opioids also explore our brain&rsquo;s reward system; the nature of addiction; the connection between opioids, alcohol abuse, and genes; and the connection between opioid sensitivity and human bonding.",56,FRSEMR 22C,13774
Time for Sleep: Impact of sleep deficiency and circadian disruption in our 24/7 Culture,"America is a sleepÃ_Â€ÂŒÂ¢Ã_Â‰Ã_Â‰Ã¥Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂêstarved nation. The Institute of Medicine estimates that between 50 and 70 million Americans are suffering from chronic sleep deficiency or sleep disorders, increasing their risk of weight gain, heart ailments, mood disorders, errors and catastrophic road accidents that kill more than 7,000 and maim more than 50,000 Americans annually. Children of all ages are sleeping about two hours less per night than they did in prior generations, rendering them hyperactive and irritable and compromising their ability to sustain attention and learn in school. This hyperactivity leads many sleepÃ_Â€ÂŒÂ¢Ã_Â‰Ã_Â‰Ã¥Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂêdeprived children to be misdiagnosed with ADHD and treated for years with amphetamines and other stimulants that further disrupt sleep. Yet, prevailing cultural attitudes lead us all to undervalue sleep and lionize allÃ_Â€ÂŒÂ¢Ã_Â‰Ã_Â‰Ã¥Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂênighters, such that most patients with sleep disorders remain undiagnosed and untreated. This seminar will explore the function of sleep, the physiologic factors that regulate sleep and circadian rhythms, the impact of exposure to artificial light on sleep and circadian rhythms, historical and cultural differences in sleep habits, and the consequences of sleep deficiency, circadian disruption and sleep disorders on both the brain and the body. Public policy issues, such as school start times, limits on resident physician work hours, drowsy driving laws, and proposed regulations to screen transportation workers for sleep disorders will be debated. Students will be encouraged to track their own sleep patterns throughout the semester, identify the personal, structural and cultural barriers to maintaining healthy sleep while in college, and propose strategies to improve sleep health at Harvard College, the local community and the nation.",56,FRSEMR 22D,13770

Women in American Medicine,"This course explores the history of women in American medicine from the colonial period to the present. We will consider both the changing place of women within the medical profession and the development of medical knowledge about women&rsquo;s health and disease. How have women practiced medicine as traditional healers, midwives, nurses, physicians, and caregivers? What is the historical relationship between female medical practitioners and the production of medical knowledge about the female body? We will pay particular attention to structural inequalities within the American medical profession and the important role that practitioners, patients, and feminists have played in challenging gender-based discrimination in medicine as well as sexist assumptions about the female body.",149,WOMGEN 1218,13250
"Gender, Biology, and the Body","This course will examine how naturalists, biologists, social scientists, sexologists, and journalists have understood questions of sex, gender and sexuality since the Enlightenment. We will become familiar with a variety of theoretical interventions in the field of feminist science studies and deploy them to understand both the scientific construction of sex and gender and the gendered culture of science. Topics will include: changing biological definitions of sex; evolutionary theories of sex and gender; cultural and scientific discourses about genes, gender, and race; and the politics and practice of feminist biology.",149,WOMGEN 1257,13651
Drawing: Exploring a Visual Language,"A studio course using the human figure as a model and subject to build the skills of drawing and expand students&rsquo; visual vocabulary. Drawing from life will be the main focus for the first part of the semester, using the model as our guide to understand the rendering of space, depth, perspective and movement. Equal emphasis will be placed on enhancing our observational sensibilities and focusing technical development, as students work both collaboratively and independently on exercises to expand individual skill with intention and purpose. During the second half of the semester we will delve into the development of abstract and conceptual principles in relation to figurative work, including expanded notions of portraiture, working from photographs and incorporating sheer invention.&nbsp;",56,FRSEMR 33D,13061
"Leaning In, Hooking Up: Visions of Feminism and Femininity in the 21st Century","What does it mean to &ldquo;do&rdquo; feminism, or to &ldquo;be&rdquo; a feminist in the 21st-century United States? What can we make of the dominant social expectations for a woman&rsquo;s life? This course explores contemporary ideals of feminine success, including their physical, familial, professional, and political manifestations. We will engage with highly-contested topics&mdash;including sexual violence and Title 9; work-life balance; the imperatives of self-care and presentation; and new models for sexuality, reproduction, family, motherhood, and domestic life&mdash;using the tools of theory and cultural studies to interrogate their framing within popular discourse. Throughout, we will critique ideological formations of gender,&nbsp;particularly as bounded by race, class, and sexuality.",149,WOMGEN 1225,13241

Death by Design: Health Inequalities in Global Perspective,"In this course, we will study health differences between social groups. We will begin by examining the extent to which health is unevenly distributed across groups defined by nationality, neighborhood, race, gender, and class. We will then seek to pinpoint the reasons for these disparities with a detailed analysis of the pathways through which these factors are linked to health status. Finally, we will discuss new research on the sociology of population health that shows how health disparities depend on meso- and macro-scale causes like neighborhoods, social policy arrangements, global organizations, and climate change.",137,SOCIOL 146,13072
Intellectual Debates in China Today,"The seminar explores different positions that well-known intellectuals are taking around three larger issues: political systems, culture, and individual values/morality. In each area we will look at the divergent arguments that are being advanced and how intellectuals locate themselves in the context of China&rsquo;s recent intellectual past and, in some cases, China&rsquo;s intellectual history since ancient times. The undercurrent is the problem of what a &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; identity can be in a global context and whether it is necessary. There will be a combination of common readings to establish issues and individual reports on particular figures and writings.",29,CHNSHIS 201,13318
Comparing India and China,"In the late 1940s, India witnessed a peaceful transition to democracy, while China experienced a Communist revolution. After this divergence, both countries began pursuing market reforms in the effort to accelerate economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s. We will explore the ways in which power has been consolidated and distributed under these very different regimes and the implications this has had for a range of socio-political and economic outcomes, including famine, economic development, and urbanization. Throughout the course we will place India and China in the context of comparative debates about other parts of the developing world.",136,SOC-STD 98PC,13784
"Mind, Matter, Me: Map your way into Philosophy","Humans clearly have minds; we just as clearly have bodies. This raises many puzzles: Are mind and body two things or one? How are they related to each other and the person called me? In this course, we&rsquo;ll look at a range of arguments about how to understand mind-body-self relations. Deeply engaging these arguments requires the skills of close reading and argument analysis. To develop these skills, this course will teach Argument Mapping, which involves identifying the essential elements of an argument and constructing a visual map that conveys the argument&rsquo;s structure at a glance.",56,FRSEMR 33F,13205

Sacred Places and Sacred Objects: The Art of Japanese Religion,"An interdisciplinary study of the art and material culture of the buddhist and Shinto religious traditions. &nbsp;The class will focus on the temples and shrines that serve as the loci of religious practice and the works of art associated with them - sculptures and paintings, sutras and reliquaries, ritual implements and temple adornments. &nbsp;It will examine in depth some of Japan&#39;s most influential sacred places, including Ise Shrine, Todaiji, the Byodoin, and Mount Fuji, and will also look at the way contemporary architects and artists such as Ando Tadao and Sugimoto Hiroshi have attempted to create new sacred places and sacred objects.",75,HAA 188V,13094
Cities in the Jungles: Maya Archaeology,"The course explores a fascinating and mysterious civilization that once flourished in the jungles of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Although most of its cities had been abandoned long before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Americas, a century of archaeological studies has revealed the world of the ancient Maya in unprecedented detail. New research methods and the decipherment of thousands of hieroglyphic inscriptions have led to recent advancements in our understanding of the indigenous history, society, politics, economy, and worldview. Rather than adopting a culture-historical narrative, this course is structured around several key problems and discussions including the emergence and the nature of statehood, relations with other Pre-Columbian civilizations of Central America, and the role of the environment in shaping and challenging the ancient way of life. The course will also address the issue of change and tensions in the paradigms of Maya archaeological studies as well as increased engagement with the indigenous communities. The course is intended for graduate and undergraduate students and requires no prior background in Maya archaeology.",6,ANTHRO 1173,13756
Language of Photography in the USA: From Walker Evans to Lorna Simpson,"Does photography have a language? For the past several decades, a series of practitioners in America have grappled with this question. By using such devices as repetition, sequence, differentiation, and spatial arrangement, artists such as Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Martha Rosler, and Lorna Simpson have considered the possibility of photography possessing a distinctive syntax within a larger social field. In this course, we will consider the history of these efforts to define and engage the limits of photographic significance.",75,HAA 177P,13404
Protest and the State,"Social movement protests challenging state policy, legitimacy and leadership have become a central feature of American political life. This tutorial explores major protest episodes in the United States, emphasizing historical trajectories and movement precedents. Four major trajectories will be considered: (1) the Civil Rights Movements of the 1950s and 1960s, and Black Lives Matter activism; (2) 1960s student movements and 2000s antiwar activism; (3) early 20th century US labor movements, and anti-globalization and Occupy Wall Street activism; and (4) suffragist and early feminist movements, and the women&#39;s movement of the 1960s and 1970s and contemporary LGBTQ activism. Students will conduct an independent research project on a movement of their choosing (not necessarily one covered in the syllabus) using the conceptual and methodological tools of sociology &ndash; archival research, content analysis, interviews, and/or ethnography. In addition to learning about issues of protest and the state, the tutorial will be dedicated to exploring issues in research design and methods. Several weeks will be devoted to student presentations and workshopping, as students develop an independent research project with original data collection.",137,SOCIOL 98MC,13483
International Development: Why Nations Succeed or Fail,"Development is a complex term. &nbsp;Although we measure it with some proxies of prosperity it does not only refer to the economy of a country or a society. One definition might be that development is a cumulative historical process, in which the economy grows with increased productivity and individuals live under better conditions with equal social rights and opportunities. This course opens up the complex puzzle of socio-economic development, and analyzes the problem from a global, historical, and comparative perspective. The course starts with discussions around the term &quot;development&quot; and then continues with canonical theoretical contributions from different disciplines. The last part of the course explores the policy aspect of development with examples and case studies from around the world.",137,SOCIOL 118,13713
"War, Revolution, and Organized Crime: In Theory, in Film, and in Reality","This course explores war, revolution and organized crime as interrelated social phenomena. Students will read sociologists, historians, political scientists and philosophers addressing the nature, causes and consequences of these phenomena in different national and historical contexts. The course will combine influential theoretical frameworks (by Karl Marx, Max Weber, Sigmund Freud, Hannah Arendt), middle-range social scientific approaches (by Anthony Giddens, Charles Tilly, Michael Mann, Theda Skocpol), and empirical and historical analyses (by Eric Hobsbawm, Benedict Anderson, James C. Scott, Eugen Weber). The three phenomena will further be scrutinized through their (mis)representation in movies by Mike Nichols, Milos Forman, Bernardo Bertolucci and others.",137,SOCIOL 133,13129
The Pursuit of Community in America,"What is community?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does it come from, and what does it accomplish?&nbsp;&nbsp;To engage these questions, we will explore community from three distinct but complimentary perspectives: ethnography, intention, and policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;We begin with classic accounts of urban and suburban communities, and more recent work on communities struggling through changes like gentrification or environmental disasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;From there we turn to communities formed through intention: cults, communes, workplace cultures, social movements, and virtual networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we consider how community enters the policy and planning domain, through community policing and new urbanist planning principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will have opportunities to reflect on their own ideas about community via analytical response papers and an original piece of research exploring a community of their own choosing.",137,SOCIOL 121,13652
Creativity and Innovation,"This course explores an intriguing problem in sociological analysis: the production of new ideas and practices as well as the reputations of their creators: How do social contexts affect creative output and inventions? How do professional communities determine when ideas are original, instead of misguided and infeasible? How does this compare across the arts, the economy, or the sciences? Specifically, the goals of the course are threefold: First, to acquaint students with key approaches on the subject in cultural sociology, economic &amp; organizational sociology, and the sociology of knowledge. Second, to discuss and deepen our understanding of what is specific about a sociological approach in comparison to other disciplines (e.g. psychology or economics), and thus to train the &quot;sociological imagination.&quot; Third, to equip students with broader skills for their own future academic and professional work. The course will involve brief lectures, student presentations, discussions, and a field trip. In addition, occasional guest presentations by Harvard scholars working in this field will enliven our discussion with interdisciplinary case studies.&nbsp;",137,SOCIOL 111,13628

"Hiphop America: Hiphop Feminism From ""Ladies First"" to ""Ride or Die""","Women have been an important part of Hiphop culture since its beginnings in the 1970s. As more artists, bloggers and scholars debate feminism and sexuality, young feminist scholars are introducing new approaches and theories that incorporate the multiple and intertwining layers of gender, sexuality, race and social class within Hiphop and as a basis for revealing and understanding the social lives of women and girls. Hiphop feminism disrupts second-wave conceptualizations of good or bad feminist identities and essentialism. This course seeks to address, analyze, explore and contest the political aspects of Hiphop music and culture through a close examination of feminism. It is an analytic space for debate and discussion about the impact of Hiphop culture on the sexual, gender and political understandings of Americans and others around the world. In addition to the traditional aspects of assigned readings, lectures and class discussions this class will include a significant independent research component, visits with experts in the field, and several activities beyond the classroom.",1,AFRAMER 153X,12918
Physics and Technology for Future Presidential Science Advisors,"In our calculus-based mechanics courses, students see physics as the paradigmatic mathematical science. But it is not until they are well into the 100 level physics classes that they begin to see in their coursework the transformative effect that physics has on the modern world. In this class, I hope to explore ways of addressing this lacuna. The course will be very loosely based on Physics and Technology for Future Presidents by Rich Muller (If you don't know this book, I recommend looking at the waves chapter - an old version but nearly complete is online http://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/physics10/PffP-textbook/PffP-07-waves-5-27.htm).",498,HSEMR-LE 73,12920
"Prints and the Circulation of Art and Images, 1700-1900","This course will examine the role of printmaking, principally during the 18th and 19th centuries. Attention will be given to prints as an independent medium for artists (the production of what is commonly called ""original prints""). But we will also be attentive to the role of ""reproductive prints"" as a mode of communication. In particular, the 18th century developing taste for drawings as collectibles gave rise to technical innovations in order to transmit the distinctive characteristics of drawings. The invention of lithography at the end of the century, and the development of a new kind of wood engraving, made possible an explosion of image production and creation of the illustrated press. Finally, the invention of photography in the central years of the 19th century caused what can be described as, a visual revolution, which deeply affected art and its reception.",75,HAA 171W,12923

Energy: Be the Change,"In the US, energy use creates large political and social tensions and&nbsp; much emphasis is placed on climate change.&nbsp; In China, health issues surrounding energy use are emerging as a critical issue. Importantly, there are many areas where the role of energy is often overlooked.&nbsp; A large fraction of current geopolitical tensions arise from issues originating in energy consumption, and that fraction may increase as water use and energy use become more closely tied. Too many discussions of energy focus on one feature of the problem, without considering how a change in one area will inevitably ripple out with the power to transform our relationships with each other and with the physical world.&nbsp; Some of those ripple effects are enormously positive, others are not. The goal of the course will be to choose energy changes that we would like to happen and to form a realistic plan for making that change occur.&nbsp; An important feature of the discussion will be considerations about what is physically possible; however, the major emphasis will be on trying to understand the connections that will be altered&nbsp; by that change.&nbsp; Any change, however laudable, inevitably creates both winners and losers. For change to happen, losers must at least be brought to accept the change. One goal of the course will be to establish local and global forums that allow us to learn more about people&rsquo;s reactions to proposals for energy change so that our proposals for change have a real possiblity of coming to pass.",56,FRSEMR 27K,12914
Topics in Chinese Art,"The seminar explores ways in which heaven is visualized in Chinese art.

Hiphop Activism: From Katrina to Ferguson,"This course examines how Hiphop political and social activism has changed how young Americans understand citizenship and active participation in society. We draw on prior research on youth activism in the U.S. and the racial and social class critique introduced in what is known as the `golden era' of Hiphop. The `golden era' occurred between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s. It is generally described as a period of experimentation in music and the introduction of socially conscious lyrics. It was during this period that social activists argued that Hiphop culture would lead to social change. In fact several Hiphop related organizations did develop including: Russell Simmons Hiphop Summit, League of Pissed Off Voters, Bad Boy's Vote or Die campaign and Black August. The overall influence of hiphop activism became apparent in 2005, when Katrina devastated the Gulf areas. For example, Lil Wayne's ""Tie My Hands"" told the heartbreaking, yet important, story of New Orleans' destruction after Hurricane Katrina and the political mismanagement that compounded the tragedy. The movement against police conduct in Ferguson has also resulted in Hiphop's response. While many are supportive, established leaders lament what they perceive to be a lack of leadership. This course addresses key questions: How do we define activism in the age of Hiphop? What is the relationship and differences between movements like Freedom Summer and Katrina and Ferguson activism. In addition to the traditional aspects of assigned readings, lectures and class discussions, this class will include a significant research component on Katrina and Ferguson protests. There will also be visits with experts in the field, and several activities beyond the classroom.",1,AFRAMER 151X,12917
The Secret Sex Life of Anthropological Objects,"Objects in museum collections lead secret lives. Enmeshed in webs of sexed and gendered significance, they speak to hidden relations of desire and the erotics of power. There is a given-ness to museum display - to the selection of objects, the breadth of their claims for representativeness, the manner of their acquisition - that this course challenges using an interdisciplinary feminist lens. What does it mean to collect human cultural and biological history? What are the roles of gender, sex, and race in shaping the politics of anthropological collection and study? How are human differences measured, and what do these systems of measurement say about the process of scientific knowledge production?Convened at Harvard&rsquo;s Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, this course invites students interested in gender, race, power, anthropology, history, biology, evolution, development, and public health, among other areas, to explore the ways in which notions of human difference influence and are shaped by the practices of anthropological study. We will examine how historical relations of gender, sex, sexuality, and imperial/racialized power continue to be narrativized, hidden, and excavated in historical and contemporary anthropological projects, exploring sex and sexuality as constitutive of other questions of inequality and violence that comprise feminist investigative enterprises.We will ground our investigation in the objects of anthropological analysis, the artifacts whose &ldquo;face values&rdquo; as things of interest to the scientific community conceal a history of struggle that includes eroticization of and violence against indigenous and colonized peoples. Chief among our goals is to work together to lay that complex, multilayered history bare. Our critique will extend to anthropology&rsquo;s deployment in contemporary contexts of international development, where the legacy of largely unidirectional scrutiny and classifications of bodies and peoples continues to haunt our present.",149,WOMGEN 2040,13495

Ancient Warfare in the Near East: An Archaeological Perspective,"People tend to be familiar with ancient warfare in the classical civilizations of the Greeks and Romans, but what was the nature of warfare in earlier historic or pre-historic societies? This course explores the meaning and impact of military and warfare in societies throughout the ancient Near East and Eastern Mediterranean. From the time of the earliest evidence for warfare until the arrival of Alexander the Great, we will investigate various forms of archaeological and historical evidence in order to address the extent to which war shaped society, while dispelling some misconceptions and possible historical biases. Lectures will be supplemented with visits to Harvard museums and special artifact sessions at the Harvard Semitic Museum.",101,ANE 219,13648
Transregional Connections: Architecture and the Construction of Early Modern Islamic Empires,"Between the 16th and 18th centuries, three empires - the Mediterranean-based Ottomans, Safavids in Iran, and Mughals in India - developed interconnected yet distinctive architectural and visual cultures with individualized ornamental idioms by fusing their common Timurid heritage with cosmopolitan regional traditions. &nbsp;Explores connections between empire building and architecture, with respect to aesthetics, religion, imperial ideology, identity, and theories of dynastic legitimacy.",75,HAA 223M,13248
Between Europe and Asia: Colonial Latin America and the Art of Fusion,"This new course will take advantage of the Fall 2015 exhibition, Made in America, at MFA to study the creative interactions between Asia and Europe as they transpired in Mexico and Peru as well as the cultural and artistic exchanges with both areas.&nbsp; In 1565, a systematic exchange between Asia and Mexico began, and known as the Manila Galleon.&nbsp; Ivories, silks, lacquer ware were brought to the port of Acapulco from Manila where they were either taken to Mexico City and sold or were transported to Lima Seville or else where.&nbsp; Chinese and Japanese artisans and diplomats also travelled to Mexico City, Madrid and Rome in the 16th and Seventeenth Centuries.&nbsp; These exchanges were equaled with European artists, diplomats and missionaries traveling to China and Japan.&nbsp; Such exchanges find resonance in the arts throughout the world, be it the choir stalls of Sucre Bolivia, or Peter Paul Ruben&rsquo;s drawing of a man from Seoul Korea.&nbsp; To be addressed in the class are issues of influence (how does it manifest itself and why) narratives of global exchange (we will read the log of a Florentine Merchant who went around the world trading, what do they tells and how and why in the early 17th century).&nbsp; How do such objects as Japanese screens become an object in Mexico and a medium of representation of cultural contact in Japan?&nbsp; Also, with the expansion of Europe into the rest of the world, how do cultures become to be seen in relation to each other?&nbsp; First and foremost was the universal desire to evangelize all parts of the known world.&nbsp; How then do these different historical element affect our understanding of Colonial Latin American art, culture and society?&nbsp;The syllabus will include reading from primary sources as well as recent studies.&nbsp; Several readings will be from the catalogue to the exhibition, which also will be our textbook.&nbsp; Students will also be able to take advantage of a two-day symposium (September 19th and 20th) to be held at Harvard and the MFA.&nbsp; Scholars from around the world will present some of the newest research on various aspects of this earliest global artistic and cultural interaction",75,HAA 199N,13113

My Genes and Cancer,"The role of a person&#39;s genetic background in determining whether he or she will develop cancer, and when, is at the center of public discussions and active scientific investigations. Already, one&rsquo;s genetic background is used in making making life-altering health decision aimed at preventing the occurrence of cancer, as was recently the case with actor Angelina Jolie. This seminar will explore the extent to which current scientific knowledge can inform this type of decisions. The goals is to gain enough understanding of the scientific background to critically evaluate the discourse of a genetic counseling session. The course will proceed at first by laying essential foundations of genetic inheritance in humans; cancer evolutionary theories; statistical risk; and decision-making in health care. Subsequently student will read articles from the scientific and popular press, and listen to podcasts. In class we will discuss the readings. There are no strict prerequisites, though some familiarity with the basic concepts of probability and genetics will be very helpful. There is a good deal of reading and listening, which everyone is expected to do ahead of class. Students can expect readings in genetics and statistics that will stretch them, though it will not always be necessary to understand all the technical details of every paper. Students can also expect to read opinion pieces with which they (as well as I) may disagree. Students will be required to write two 5-page double spaced essays (midterm and final) and to lead a class discussion on the topic of one of their two papers. A typical paper is the critique of a scientific or popular press article, chosen from a list of suggested options or identified independently by the student, with my approval, during the first seven weeks of classes. Attendance is essential, not only for the students&rsquo; education, but for the benefit their contributions provide to the others.",56,FRSEMR 22H,13490

Islam and Image,"A common stereotype is that Islam is against images, a deficit resulting from religious doctrine and endemic iconoclasm that in turn fostered the arts of writing and geometric abstraction without figuration. Such assertions are misleading and incomplete. The seminar looks at the broad scope of two-dimensional images produced throughout the Islamic lands from the formation of Islam in the seventh century to the present day. Selected case studies span diverse subject matters, media (from ink and watercolor to print and photography), functions, and contexts of use, and invite examination of a spectrum of formal operations and modalities of representation",75,HAA 123N,13796

Brave New Worlds: Imagining the Futures of Science,"Writers, filmmakers, and artists have often used speculative fiction to comment on new knowledge about the natural world, and to think about how that knowledge might affect humanity&rsquo;s future. Some works of art express hope that science and technology will improve the human condition; others express anxiety about the consequences of scientific findings and technological developments. This seminar examines science fiction (broadly defined) in its historical context and considers how specific works both reflected and shaped changing beliefs about science and its role in society. Students will analyze works of fiction alongside scholarly literature about developments in the history of science. Topics will include poems and treatises about &ldquo;new worlds&rdquo; written during the Scientific Revolution, fables from Victorian Britain that drew on Charles Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution, fiction and films about radioactivity and nuclear war, and science fiction about gender and fertility written during and after the women&rsquo;s movement.",76,HISTSCI 194V,13134
The History of Hunger,"Why did a Jamestown colonist butcher and eat his pregnant wife? Why were Gandhi&rsquo;s hunger strikes so politically effective? This seminar will examine hunger in United States and global history from the early modern era to the present, considering topics including hunger strikes, famine, eating disorders, and the scientific study of hunger. Exploring hunger from a variety of angles, including food history, the environment, policy, empire, gender, and ethics, this course will analyze the impact that hunger has had on history, as well as changing ideas about hunger over time.",72,HIST 60T,13620
Quantum Mechanics Face to Face,"This course is for students who would like to be introduced to the ideas of quantum mechanics without the rigor of&nbsp; mathematics&nbsp; but who would be interested in learning by demonstration as well as spoken word and picture. We will be guided by a non-mathematical text Introducing Quantum Theory,&nbsp; read short pieces by the&nbsp; creators of quantum theory, including Bohr, EInstein, Hesienberg and&nbsp; Schrodinger, and&nbsp; each week watch and play with physics demonstrations of&nbsp; wave and particle physics. This course requires reading, watching short films, watching demonstrations in the lab and visiting places at the university where quantum mechanics is used on a daily basis.",56,FRSEMR 22S,13654
Physics and Big Questions,"Three types of big questions will be considered. The first are the big questions about the limits and domain of physics. To start, what are the limits and domain of applicability of the classical physics studies studied in high school? How do these relate to special relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory? Next, what are some of the big questions that physics seeks to answer. For example, what is the &quot;standard model&quot; of particle physics and how is it tested? Other important big questions relate to how physics informs some major challenges to our society. For example, what does physics say about the options for powering our homes and cars given limited petroleum reserves and the need to reduce carbon dioxide production?&nbsp; The final set of big questions is about the compatibility or incompatibility of physics and religious faith. Here we will consider very divergent answers in a climate of respect for what will be big differences in opinion.",56,FRSEMR 22V,13287
Collecting the Past,"This seminar will explore historical practices of collecting and displaying Classical art in museums from the earliest periods through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to most recent times, including the contemporary debate about cultural property and the acquisition policies of museums. The seminar will consider how various forms of collecting and archiving &ndash; such as collections of war booty in ancient Rome, cabinets of curiosities in the Renaissance, or modern art museums from the 18th century onwards &ndash; have shaped our knowledge and understanding of the past.",56,FRSEMR 33H,13136
The Role of Government,"Economists have a very positive view of the role of markets. The intellectual foundations of this are the first and second theorems of welfare economics. The purpose of the seminar is to introduce the students to these results but also to their limitations. For example, for markets to work well it is essential to have a legal system that upholds contracts and protects property rights. The legal system is also important to deter crime. But who can provide the legal system other than a government that has the coercive power to raise taxes? The legal system is an example of a public good, but of course there are many others including national defense, clean air, etc. Markets under-provide public goods and they also do not work well in the presence of externalities, a highly topical example of which is global warming resulting from carbon emissions. Another very topical issue is inequality. There is no particular reason to think that a market economy will yield an equitable distribution of income, and given this what is the appropriate government response? Throughout the seminar the analysis of ideas and concepts will be interspersed with policy issues such as whether and what limitations should be placed on the right to smoke or consume drugs, the right to marry, the right to buy and sell organs, the right to bear arms, and the freedom of businesses to decide whom to serve. We will also consider the pros and cons of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the role of government nudges, and whether goods or services paid for by the government need to be produced by the government or can be outsourced: the issue of privatization.",56,FRSEMR 42C,13526
"The Chinese Language, Present and Past","This course offers an opportunity to learn about the Chinese language in ways that will be of use both to prospective Chinese language learners and to students curious about the structure, history, cultural traditions, and social relevance of the language. Taking a partly hands-on approach, we will examine the fundamental principles that make up the sound system and govern the grammar of Mandarin, looking closely at its system of tones, its writing system, and the issues of Chinese as a heritage language. Looking deeper, we will see how the study of Chinese can contribute to understanding language as a central component of human cognition.",56,FRSEMR 33R,13600
Exploring the Infinite,"Infinity captivates the imagination. A child stands between two mirrors and sees herself reflected over and over again, smaller and smaller, trailing off to infinity. Does it go on forever?&nbsp; &hellip; Does anything go on forever?&nbsp; Does life go on forever?&nbsp; Does time go on forever? Does the universe go on forever?&nbsp; Is there anything that we can be certain goes on forever? ... It would seem that the counting numbers go on forever, since given any number on can always add one.&nbsp; But is that the extent of forever? Or are there numbers that go beyond that?&nbsp; Are there higher and higher levels of infinity?&nbsp; And, if so, does the totality of all of these levels of infinity itself constitute the highest, most ultimate, level of infinity, the absolutely infinite? In this seminar we will begin our exploration of the infinite with questions like these. We will examine the different senses of the infinite by seeing how the infinite arises in many disciplines, from theology to the arts, from physics to modern mathematics. We will eventually focus on the infinite in mathematics and we will pursue its systematic study. But even here we are beset by difficulties. For there are so-called ``paradoxes of the infinite&#39;&#39;, paradoxes that have led some to the conclusion that the concept of infinity is incoherent. We will see, however, that what these paradoxes ultimately show is that the infinite is just quite different than the finite and that by being very careful we can sharpen the concept of infinity so that these paradoxes are transformed into surprising discoveries. We will follow the historical development, starting with the work of Cantor at the end of the nineteenth century, and proceeding up to the present. The study of the infinite has blossomed into a beautiful branch of mathematics. We will get a glimpse of this subject, and the many levels of infinity, and we will see that the infinite is even more magnificent than one might ever have imagined.",56,FRSEMR 23C,13777
The Problem of Evil and the Nature of Human Freedom,"Common sense seems to confirm the reality of evil.&nbsp; From the genocides of the 20th century to the homicides that fill our daily news, evil seems to be a category of ordinary language and experience.&nbsp; But what do we really mean when we use the word &ldquo;evil&rdquo; to describe a person, an action or an historical event? Why does the word pack an emotional punch that other terms do not?&nbsp; The term &ldquo;evil&rdquo; seems to point to an incomprehensible quality that marks the limits of human understanding and control.&nbsp; Theologians, philosophers and poets have long struggled with these limits, drawing on their deepest imaginative powers in writing about the meaning and consequences of evil.&nbsp; This course will consider key texts in Western philosophy, theology and other literary forms that have sought to frame the question and offer readers avenues for responding to the problem of evil. &nbsp;",56,FRSEMR 34C,13332
"Crime and Punishment in the United States , 1800-2000","This course will examine the history of crime and punishment in the United States from the nineteenth through the twentieth century. We will examine early ideas about crime and punishment, and how they changed over the past two centuries. Topics will include the rise of the penitentiary, the rise and decline of the Southern convict lease system, progressive era penal knowledge and reform, and the criminalization of alcohol and drugs during the 1920s Prohibition era. Finally, &nbsp;the rise of the system of mass incarceration since the 1970s will be discussed.",56,FRSEMR 42F,13605
Ireneo Funes and Big Data,"Ireneo Funes, the protagonist of the fantasy story &ldquo;Funes the Memorious&rdquo;, had an absolutely amazing memory. Funes was capable of memorizing the tiniest detail of every single day, yet he was incapable of making sense of it. The statistician and historian Stephen Stigler called Funes &ldquo;Big Data without Statistics&rdquo;. Using Stigler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom&rdquo; (2015, Harvard University Press) as the primary reading, we will explore seven statistical principles and insights that are crucial in preventing ourselves from becoming the Funes of the 21st century. This seminar is particularly suited for those whose happiness lies in understanding the philosophical underpinnings of quantitative thinking under uncertainty.",56,FRSEMR 23D,13290
Dead Cthulhu Waits Dreaming: H.P. Lovecraft and Mythology,"H.P. Lovecraft, the American writer of science fiction, horror, and fantasy, created a cosmology, a mythology,&nbsp; and an alternative vision of life and reality so compelling that over the years some readers have come to believe that his invented Necronomicon is a real book (in the Widener stacks). Like his predecessor, Edgar Allan Poe, Lovecraft lived and died without recognition in his own country: American culture then as now valued practicality and social engagement.&nbsp; What is it, then, that captivates Lovecraftians? The seminar will explore the invention of personal mythologies, languages, and narratives of counter-realities by Lovecraft and other writers (including Poe, C.G. Jung, Ursula Le Guin, Colin Wilson, and Philip K. Dick) as ways of individuation, and of resistance to conformity, through creative imagination. &nbsp;",56,FRSEMR 34D,13110
The U.S. Energy Revolution and its Implications,"How we produce and use energy has major implications for the economy, energy security, and climate change. The U.S. &ldquo;energy revolution&rdquo; &ndash; nonconventional oil and gas production (fracking), increasing use of renewable energy, and reduced demand &ndash; has contributed to a sharp decline in U.S. oil imports, a 10% reduction in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. This course examines the changing U.S. energy landscape, energy security, U.S. climate policy, and the connection between these issues and our own lives. The conceptual framework is economics (but no prior economics is assumed), a powerful tool for understanding market failures and for designing government policies that are efficient, effective, and appropriate. The course starts by looking at our &ndash; your &ndash; energy and carbon footprint, how much it can change, and how it connects with broader issues of energy markets, energy security, and climate change. The course then dives into three current policy issues: biofuels, the mining of coal from public lands, and the regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. In each case, critics complain that these policies are expensive, ineffective, and/or have unintended consequences, while others complain that they don&rsquo;t go far enough given the magnitude of the challenge posed by climate change, and we will evaluate these arguments.",56,FRSEMR 42H,13137
The Folklore of Gaelic Scotland,"This course explores the &lsquo;treasure house&rsquo; of Gaelic folklore recorded in the Highlands of Scotland since the nineteenth century. The international controversy over Macpherson&rsquo;s &#39;Ossian&#39; poems in the 1760s prompted interest in the Scottish Gaelic folklore from which they were adapted. Folklorists have since documented a wealth of orally recorded material, including tales of ancient heroes (e.g. Finn McCool) and beliefs in malevolent fairies, seal-people, dangerous water-horses, the evil eye and second sight. As we explore these fascinating topics, we will take into account international scholarly approaches to folklore.&nbsp;",56,FRSEMR 34F,13301
Technology to Save the World,"Technology designers are the new policy makers. No one elected them and most people do not know their names, but the arbitrary decisions they make when producing the latest gadgets and online innovations dictate the code by which we conduct our daily lives and govern our countries. As technology progresses, every societal value and every state rule comes up for grabs and will likely be redefined by what technology enables or not. No one is thinking about how it all fits together or falls apart.&nbsp; This class is a hands-on lab exploration to reveal unusual and insightful ways technology is changing our world and what we, in our lab course, can do to shape that change.",56,FRSEMR 42R,13627

Seeing Sculptures Out Walking: Studio Course,"A studio course considering the possibility of sculpture to be autonomous in different contexts, ranging from the moment when an object is liberated from its original circumstances of production to its continuing life and how it might reflect on new situations.&nbsp; Using a variety of materials, including &quot;found footage&quot;, we will investigate the sculptural qualities of an environment, and consider the roles that reality and immediacy can play in artistic procedure.\n\n&nbsp;",162,VES 33,13041
The Middle East from 1914 to the present,"How did the Middle East become modern? This course surveys the history of the Middle East from the First World War to the Arab Spring. Starting with a brief account of Ottoman history during the 19th century, the course deals with such topics as the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the formation of its successor states in the wake of WWI; the rise of Arab nationalism; the Arab-Israeli conflict; the politics of oil; political Islam; feminism and gender relations; the rise of authoritarian regimes; and the struggle for democracy leading up to the outbreak of the Arab Spring.",72,HIST 1881,13752
Sculpture as Narrative: Studio Course,"A studio course that seeks to approach sculpture through narrative, exploring how different forms of narration might appear in sculpture or be used to suggest process.&nbsp; Objects and stories might mutually influence each other or transform over time.&nbsp; A sculptural installation, developed over the course of the semester, generates room for many meta-narratives, while a self-made publication will both document and fictionalize the work.",162,VES 35,13092
Material Histories: Advanced Sculpture,"The history of sculpture is a story of constant recycling: forms are discarded, lost techniques rediscovered, and old materials are revived. This course will investigate the production of meaning through sculptural materials, their historic usage, and shifting cultural contexts.&nbsp;Through hands-on experimentation, readings, projects, and lectures, we will explore a range of materials - from clay to plastics - and related methods.&nbsp;Students will pursue their interests through research and development of individual projects.",162,VES 130G,13624
"Christianity and Slavery in America, 1619-1865","Most people today assume that Christianity and slavery are incompatible. For most of Christian history, however, the opposite was true. Christians not only owned slaves, but they argued that slavery was sanctioned by the Bible. This course will explore the relationship between Christianity and slavery in America from 1619, when the first slaves arrived in Virginia, to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. We will ask several questions. How did white Christians become convinced that slavery was sinful? Why did many slaves convert to Christianity, the religion of their oppressors? How did enslaved Christians make sense of their suffering? Students will read major historical interpretations of slavery, but they will particularly focus on primary documents, including proslavery tracts and sermons, abolitionist speeches, poems, and the personal religious narratives of enslaved men and women. We will also read parts of Harriet Beecher Stowe&rsquo;s Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin, one of the most controversial novels ever published in the United States. In addition to discussing the readings during class meetings, we will listen to spirituals and analyze paintings, photos, and other objects (for example, abolitionist tokens). In addition to our regular class meetings, we will take a guided walking tour of Boston&rsquo;s Black Heritage Trail. The tour will include an exploration of the African Meeting House.",56,FRSEMR 43D,13511
Anatomy and Ethical Transgressions in National Socialism,"This course introduces students to the history and ethics of anatomy, and their relevance for current questions in medicine concerning the human body in life and death. The story of anatomy in National Socialist (NS or Nazi) Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the anatomical sciences and reveals the complex relationship between anatomists and the Nazi regime. The historic causes of this development will be explored by examining the roots of the biologistic NS ideology in the connections between anatomy, physical anthropology, the global eugenics movement and German racial hygiene. Many anatomists became members of the NS party, while others were persecuted for so-called &ldquo;racial&rdquo; and political reasons. An examination of the history of anatomical body procurement from ancient Greece to the 21st century demonstrates the changes of the traditional sources of bodies for anatomical dissection under NS rule, resulting in the use of many bodies of NS victims for anatomical purposes. Anatomical research changed with the exploitation of the rising number of bodies of executed men and women. Case studies of the work of individual anatomists reveal a gradual shift in the paradigm of anatomy. A few anatomists left the traditional paradigm- i.e. the gain of anatomical knowledge through work with the dead- in favor of a new paradigm- i.e. work with the &ldquo;future dead&rdquo;- in human experiments on prisoners who were subsequently murdered. Ultimately, anatomists became complicit with the government through their role in the complete destruction of the perceived &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; of the NS regime.",56,FRSEMR 23H,13291
David Lynch & David Cronenberg,"In the course, we will work through the rich, complex filmographies of David Lynch and David Cronenberg. Both filmmakers explore the darker edges of the North American psyche through fantastic, surreal, and often horrific scenarios.

The focus will be on the works themselves, with a variety of critical texts supporting our analytical project. This course includes a mandatory weekly film screening.&nbsp;",162,VES 194H,13753
Enchanted Cinema,"We will study films that concern themselves with the enchanted state of early childhood; and with the myths children create to make sense of the world. We&rsquo;ll also look at films made with the same sense of wonder and uninhibited daring children experience when making art. We&rsquo;ll study canonical masterpieces, disguised fairy tales, outsider filmmakers, Poverty Row gems, startling experiments and films repurposed by a second director to make new fiction from an intervention.&nbsp;Students will respond with scripts, essays and/or visual essays.\n&nbsp;",162,VES 172M,13677
Falling from the Grip of Grace: A Critical Reading of Contemporary Art and Exhibitions,"This course studies the intersection of artists, institutions, and audiences in making, exhibiting, and experiencing contemporary art. It combines readings, discussions, and practice to look at curatorial and artistic production with attention to changing roles of spectators.

This course will pay particular attention to regional and cross-&shy;national variation in urban change and inequality.",137,SOCIOL 98SD,13645
"Studying Up: Privilege, Elite Education, and Inequality","Privilege is an understudied but important topic in educational and social science research. Recent scholarship increasingly attends to the role that elite educational institutions play in producing and maintaining social and economic inequalities. In this course, we will investigate the connections between class, privilege, and educational advantage. By employing the lens of cultural sociology, we will explore various contexts for elite education, the cultural practices around which they are organized, and the ways in which individuals negotiate a sense of legitimacy and identity within these spaces.",137,SOCIOL 98TA,13078
White Collar Blues?:  Work in the Age of Flexible Capitalism,"Does flexible work lead to liberation or loss of identity?&nbsp; Does it bring self-fulfillment or insecurity?&nbsp; This course will examine the ways in which workers&rsquo; connections to employers, occupations, and locations have become more fluid and transitory, and we will critically engage in the debate about the social and personal consequences of such &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; labor.&nbsp; We will investigate what flexibility means in a variety of economic sectors and occupations, exploring the experience of work in the contemporary political economy with an eye toward both its liberating and oppressive potential.&nbsp; How do different forms of work affect our personalities, life circumstances, and connections to each other?&nbsp; What is meaningful work?&nbsp; Our approach will be rooted in the crucial question of workers&rsquo; control over their own labor and we will explore this through case studies.&nbsp; What does flexibility mean for tech workers in Silicon Valley and bankers on Wall Street?&nbsp; Throughout the course we will pay particular attention to occupations where social class is ambiguous or problematic, leading us to the question: what does it mean to be a worker versus a professional?&nbsp; In examining the labor process under modern capitalism we will focus on both its structural aspects as well as on culture, ideology, and identity.&nbsp; And we will examine how the workplace intersects with gender, the family, and one&rsquo;s experience outside of the factory gate or office cubicle.&nbsp; We will read prominent social theorists along with a variety of ethnographic accounts which in different ways seek to elucidate the conditions of work under modern capitalism.",56,FRSEMR 43H,13010
A History of Latin American Cinema,"An overview of the history and development of cinema throughout Latin America, beginning with the impact of the neo-realist movement in the 1950s, moving to the modernist experimentation of the 1960s and 1970s, and concluding with examples of recent directions in film and media. We will investigate the frequent interaction between the realms of &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; that has characterized so much of the best Latin American cinema.

The Psychology and Economics of Beliefs,"This junior seminar focuses on how individuals and groups come to form beliefs about important things in their lives. What medicines are effective? What lifestyles are healthy? What investment strategies make sense? What careers are lucrative and rewarding? What is the right way to raise children? What economic systems are efficient and fair? We will review theories and evidence about how individuals develop their beliefs from personal observations and experience, and how people learn from each other. The organizing theme will be to compare the assumption of full rationality that is traditional in economic theory to evidence identified by psychologists and others about the types of errors people make. We will also explore what consequences these errors have. When do people become overconfident in their beliefs? Or instead not learn as much as they should? Are people&#39;s beliefs internally consistent? When do groups of people all come to the same conclusions, vs. &quot;polarize&quot; into very different beliefs?Because of the heavy emphasis on rigorous formal theories and measurements along the lines of mainstream economics, the course requires background in microeconomics, mathematics, and statistics.Required readings for the course will include academic research in psychology, economic theory, empirical economics, and historical and sociological research describing the prevalence and changes in beliefs over time. The core requirement is to develop an independent research project in the tradition of theoretical or empirical economics, but regular reading and participation in will also be required.",45,ECON 980Y,13112
"The Empire Strikes Back: Science Fiction, Religion, and Society","\tFrom the seventeenth century to today, science fiction has reflected the aspirations of scientific innovation and anticipated new discoveries. It has reflected rhetorical practices by which science melds present contexts with futurism, extrapolation, and promissory logics. Authors have engaged with ethical problems, fears about innovations gone awry, and pessimism about the prospects of technological development, all while critiquing views on gender, race, and sexuality, and subverting colonial ambitions while engaging postcolonial aspirations. At the same time, science fiction has engaged religious and spiritual views, both interacting with religious imaginaries and engaging with the role of religion in society and in relation to science.\t&nbsp;\tIn this course, we trace science fiction through history. We analyze how it has understood science and technology, war and colonialism, sex, race and gender, health and disease. We investigate how it has interacted with religion and influenced social and cultural attitudes. We will read major works in science fiction and understand how they live with and within us. Topics include: time travel, utopias and dystopias, race, gender, and sexuality, religion and culture, embodiment and disembodiment, posthumanism). In addition to novels and short stories, lectures will incorporate film, television, graphic novels, music videos, and other science fictional subgenres.\t&nbsp;\tThe course will be accompanied by a film series of major science fiction films and guest speakers (film series attendance is optional).\t&nbsp;",76,HISTSCI 192,13325

Risk and Intimacy,"How do individuals negotiate the pleasures and perils of intimate life? How are the individual decisions we make in our most personal relationships affected by the world around us? To what extent is our ability to feel and express affection, trust other people, and to maintain curiosity about and empathy for the experiences of those who differ from us impacted by structural inequalities and the constraints of culture? In this class we will examine the relationships between of ideas of risk and vulnerability and the ways individual people come to know, understand, depend on, cooperate with, protect, love, engage in sexual relations with, grieve and mourn other people. We will begin by examining these questions from a macro-structural level, with readings by Elizabeth Povinelli, Michael Warner, Judith Butler and Samuel Delaney on the relationship of governance to love and empathy, and Avery Gordon, Saidiya Hartman and Alice Goffman on the impacts of institutional violence on intimate relationships. We will then look at the ways different contemporary sexual communities manage emotional and bodily risk, with readings on BDSM by Leopold von Sacher-Masoc, Stacy Newmahr and Margot Weiss and readings on HIV/AIDS and gay male sexual subjectivity by David Halperin, Leo Bersani, Tim Dean and Michael Bronski. We will read texts on queer forms of intimacy like friendship, chosen families and nonmonogamous erotic attachments by Michel Foucault, Jamie Heckert and Dossie Easton. Finally, we will read a collection of first-person fiction and nonfiction accounts of navigating vulnerability and interpersonal intimacy in the digital age. Students will write a series of short reflection and reading response papers over the course of the semester and engage in a collaborative process of working to form an intellectually and interpersonally intimate learning environment with their peers.",149,WOMGEN 1470,13698
Eureka! An Anthropology of Innovation,"To be human is to have the ability to adapt and innovate. The creative and generative spirit of human thought and action is considered to bridge the dividing lines of cultures and nations. An emphasis on innovation and creative solutions has risen in the past decade, as global crises, such as climate change, economic instability, and epidemics, challenge life as we know it. In this class we examine the idea of innovation to explore its processes and politics. We explore both the potential and perils of innovation through specific case studies in technology, artistic endeavors, entrepreneurial initiatives, and everyday life.We approach the idea of innovation through a constellation of terms that accompany it: creativity, generativity, improvisation, ingenuity, entrepreneurism, and cultural and technological change. We will ask: Why and how do we innovate? What does it mean to innovate? What are the historical and geographic conditions and the tools and technologies that enable innovation? In this day and age of celebration of entrepreneurial activity and creative collaborations: we ask who is read as innovative and what are the limits of the innovative endeavor?The course begins with classic texts on creative processes to discuss the innovative human condition. We juxtapose these with texts on the politics of creation. We will think through innovative processes and discuss the idea of the innovative in the every day. Ethnographic monographs will raise questions of body, technology race, class, education, mobility, and gender. How do these change the way we read innovation? We will end by examining how innovation might work with or against modes of exploitation and domination.",6,ANTHRO 1951,13274

"The Black Power Debates: Politics, Philosophy, and Culture","From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, the political and cultural lives of African-Americans were riven by an extraordinary moment of radicalism, experimentation, and transformation known as the Black Power Movement. Our popular memory of this era, with its iconography of Afros, guns, and riots, has unfortunately obscured many of the most challenging political and ethical dilemmas it brought to the fore, as well as more serious assessments of why Black Power emerged and what, if anything, political struggle under this sign achieved. This course, therefore, will return to primary sources from this era, as well as retrospective reflections, in order to engage the complex philosophical, political, economic, and cultural arguments that animated the passionate debates, intensive struggles, and tragic violence this movement engendered, at home and abroad. This task is especially important in our contemporary moment, where &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; activists make frequent reference to Black Power icons and American cities are experiencing violent unrest. The course will cover such topics as the philosophy and sociology of nationalism; political violence, riots, and non-violent protest; political theology and soulcraft; critiques of integrationism; aesthetics and politics; &ldquo;identity&rdquo; politics; and feminist, liberal, conservative, and leftist criticisms of Black Power. For advanced undergraduates and graduate students with some knowledge of post-World War II African-American history.&nbsp;",1,AFRAMER 132X,13070

Women and Work in the United States,"Women have always worked. But the content, conditions, and location of their work have changed drastically, moving from farmhouses, plantations, and family workshops to factories, offices, and private homes. This course explores the causes and consequences &ndash; social, cultural, political, and economic &ndash; of this transformation. Drawing on primary and secondary sources, we ask: How has the concept of &ldquo;work&rdquo; been gendered? What forces pushed or pulled women into the workforce? How has American society resisted or accommodated the rising numbers of mothers working outside the home? How has women&rsquo;s work been shaped by class, race, and ethnicity?",72,HIST 13F,13721
Religions in Chinese Society from Late Imperial to Contemporary,"This course will help students to understand the present-day situations of a wide array of religions that exist in the mainland Chinese society, including popular religion, Buddhism, Daoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, New Religious Movements, and Islam. We will discuss their institutional practices, positions in the society, relations with the state and the economy. The course will also examine how the present-day conditions came into being, by tracing to the traditional model of late imperial China (1368&ndash;1911), and investigating how changes occurred in Republican China (1911&ndash;1949), why the Maoist period (1949&ndash;1976) was the turning point, and how a new religious situation with characteristics distinct from the traditional model has been emerging in post-Mao China. We will make reference to the religious situations in Taiwan to illustrate the distinctiveness of the case of mainland China.",29,CHNSHIS 122,13741
"Studying Religions in China:  Texts, Theoretical and Methodological Issues","This seminar will consist of two parts.

Human Migration and US-Mexico Borderlands: Moral Dilemmas and Sacred Bundles,"Responding to one of the major political, economic and religious developments of our times, this seminar locates the immigration crisis of the Mexico-U.S. borderlands within the epic context of human migration in history and global perspectives. The first part of the seminar will read and critique a series of books and articles about human migration, Mexican migrations to the U.S. in the last 120 years and the enigma and fluidity of national borders. The seminar will then develop a comparative perspective on immigration by comparing Mexican migrations with migrations from a) Latin America to the U.S, b) the African American migration within the U.S. from south to north, c) contemporary migrations from Africa to countries of the European Union. Questions such as &#39;what economic and political forces cause people to migrate?&#39;, &#39;do they migrate as individuals or families?&#39;. &#39;How do walls, fences and borders work and what do they mean?&#39; and &#39;what is immigration reform-anyway?&#39; will be explored. We will examine the profound economic and moral dilemmas facing migrants, families, sending and receiving countries. The course uses Professor Carrasco&#39;s concept of &#39;sacred bundles&#39; to explore the question &#39;what cultural and religious resources help migrants survive the ordeal of migration and establish new identities?&#39;",6,ANTHRO 1401,13019
Case Studies - Law and Literature,"This seminar examines the relationship between legal discourses and poetic representations of justice from the late 18th to the 21st Century. Can literature offer poetic justice when, as Schiller suggests, the legal system fails? Moreover, to what extent can literature adequately testify to historical events? Is fiction necessarily false testimony? Or is testimony fictional? Following an initial examination of Aeschylus&rsquo; Eumenides, where the vengeful furies yield power to the law, the course turns to modern depictions of criminals (Schiller, Goethe, B&uuml;chner, Kleist), holy justice (Droste-H&uuml;lshoff, Gotthelf), historical trials (Kippardt), and human rights (Arendt). We will conclude with the on-going debate about vengeance and forgiveness in literature and film (Wiesenthal, Am&eacute;ry, Tarantino).Ã_Â€ÂŒÂ¢Ã_Â‰Ã_Â‰Ã¥Ã_Â‰ÂŒÃ‚With texts from Weimar Classicism, Romanticism, Realism and Modernism, the seminar offers a cultural-theoretical framework for reading each literary epoch alongside historical legal developments.",65,GERMAN 171,13783
Ceramic Arts of Korea,"From ancient to modern times, people have been using ceramics as their basic utensils to protect, store, cook and eat, resulting in the production of different forms of ceramics.

Literatures of Excess in Modern China,"Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary &ldquo;excess&rdquo; that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime &ndash; in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction, poetry and drama, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality&rsquo;s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.",30,CHNSLIT 131,13750

Critical Study of Midrash,"The aim of this course is to introduce students to the contemporary critical study of midrash, the literature of classical Rabbinic Biblical interpretation.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be primarily concerned with two questions: 1) How did the Rabbis read the Bible? and 2) What can midrash, as a form of&nbsp; literary discourse in its own right, tell us about its authors, the Rabbinic sages who lived in the first five centuries in the common era?&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also compare midrash to other types of ancient Jewish interpretation, discuss the various hermeneutical and literary theoretical issues that have figured in recent scholarship, and consider its place in the history of Jewish Biblical exegesis. &nbsp;&nbsp;Texts to be read will run the entire gamut of Rabbinic literature (including both Tannaitic and Amoraic collections, and midrash halakhah as well as midrash aggadah). &nbsp;All readings will be in the original language, and students are expected to be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts (although pointed texts will be supplied whenever possible).&nbsp;&nbsp; No other previous background in Rabbinic literature is required.&nbsp;",108,HEBREW 243,13293
Introduction to Model Organisms,"Model organisms are embedded in our scientific culture, from text books on the discovery of genetic material, to mod-encode genome projects. This quarter course is a means to formally introduce an enormously successful experimental scientific approach that has revealed uncountable new biological mechanisms for the last 70 years. Students in this class will engage in hands-on learning exercises to become familiar with commonly used model organisms. They will learn about the genesis of each model system and compare and contrast the features and available experimental approaches that govern whether a particular organism is an appropriate model for different biological phenomena.",98,MCB 354,13025
"Germany and Europe: Heimat, Exile, Return","\tThis course discusses 20th and 21st Century German culture and poetics in dialogue and dispute with its European neighbors.

"Women, Court, and the Japanese Monarchy: 600-1400","Historians call the late Heian and early Kamakura period &ldquo;a time of the governance by the retired monarchs&rdquo; (insei), thereby emphasizing the political influence of retired male royals. This master narrative, however, suggests that early medieval Japan was steadily becoming a more patriarchal and male-dominant society. This obscures a more complex explanation of court politics and power relations. This storyline also dismisses the fact that royal women received a title of nyoin, which was the female equivalent to a retired male monarch. In this course, we will examine premodern Japanese kinship and kingship by exploring the history of royal women and supporters of the court, including female attendants, warriors, and local estate officials. Likewise, we will investigate how Heian and Kamakura court women managed to access power and pursued their own political, cultural, and religious goals although they were limited in obtaining official government posts. Throughout the course we will also think about how studies of the Japanese court and monarchy have been echoed in questions asked by scholars of other regions and times.&nbsp;",35,JAPNHIST 203,13251
Comparative History of Women and Gender In East Asia up to WWII,"A comparative perspective is a challenging but important approach for studying women&rsquo;s andgender history; it helps us generate new questions by seeing things that have been taken forgranted. In this course, we will learn the histories of East Asian women by investigating changinggender roles and power relations from approximately 600 to 1945. Under important topics such asfemale rulership, legal rights, family, religion, and sexuality, we will compare experiences andrepresentations of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese women, to understand diverse but still sharedcultures from which East Asian women and men invented new customs and traditions.The relationship between authority and power is a central theme for this course. We first defineauthority and power. Then we will investigate historical cases in which women successfully orunsuccessfully used their authority and wielded power to accomplish their goals by negotiatingchallenges related to their gender roles and existing social expectations. Although we will focuson cases of women, we will compare those with other cases (men, transgenderism, etc.) to fullyunderstand complex authority-power relations.While examining course materials in a roughly chronological order, we will refer back topreviously discovered information and ideas by focusing on several important questions:1) Did women have legally or socially acknowledged rights?&nbsp; If so, what kinds of rights were they? How did women use&nbsp; them?2) When women lacked certain rights, under what circumstances did women still exercise power?And how?3) Is there an underlying force that tends to maintain gender disparity? How did it shape institutional and sociocultural mechanisms and affect the experiences of women and men as well as gender construction?",35,JAPNHIST 121,13488
Masculinities and Health: History and Politics of Men's Health and Illness,"This course will introduce recent theories of masculinity and performativity in gender theory with the aim of exploring possible links to medical and public health constructions of the male body and men&rsquo;s health. From 19th century concerns about degeneration and the identification of &ldquo;effete&rdquo; male to the military&rsquo;s failed policy of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; we will consider the various ways cultural anxieties about &ldquo;manliness&rdquo; have been addressed by medical, psychological, and public health experts. Topical areas will include: risk taking, sports, body image, sexuality, violence, depression, ADHD, sociopathy, suicide, aging and life expectancy.",76,HISTSCI 142V,13633
The Changing Concept of Race in America: From Jefferson to Genomics,"This course explores changing concepts of race in American science and medicine, and examines the historical meanings and uses of these concepts in U.S. society from the 18th century to the present. The course asks the following questions: How have diverse scientific and medical disciplines historically defined, measured, and produced knowledge about &ldquo;race&rdquo;? How have scientific and medical concepts of race historically interrelated with key political, economic, and social institutions? How do current 21st century genomic concepts of race fit into this larger history of race and science?&nbsp;",76,HISTSCI 147,13689
Sciences of History,"What is historical method, and in what sense might history be made a science? Proposed answers to these questions have varied over time, in part according to changing conceptions of science and its methods.

Re-evaluating the Sacred Image in the Renaissance,"Recent art historical debates concerning the definition of the Renaissance have addressed a wide range of issues&mdash;from chronological to geographical to methodological.&nbsp; New questions of a globalized Renaissance have been posed alongside calls for a more broadly conceived notion what constitutes art and artistic culture.&nbsp; Perhaps one of the most deeply entrenched concepts of the previous era that has come under intense scrutiny is the notion of the Renaissance as the moment during which, as Hans Beling phrased it, &ldquo;the holy image could not escape its metamorphosis into a work of art.&rdquo;&nbsp; This course will examine previous and current formulations of the sacred image in the Renaissance, focusing primarily, though not exclusively, on works, theories, and historiography pertaining to the Italian peninsula.&nbsp;",75,HAA 252X,13587
Modern Architecture,"This course charts the rise of the architectural avant-gardes and transformations in modern architecture in the 20th century. We explore the drama in the story of modern architecture, how major figures navigated cataclysmic events, shifting ideological and political forces, the changing demands of mass societies, and radical challenges to the modernist project itself, in their attempts to shape a new world.

Introduction to Social and Biological Networks,"Many systems of scientific and societal interest consist of a large number of interacting components. The structure of these systems can be represented as networks where network nodes represent the components and network edges the interactions between the components. Network analysis can be used to study how pathogens, behaviors and information spread in social networks, having important implications for our understanding of epidemics and the planning of effective interventions. In a biological context, at a molecular level, network analysis can be applied to gene regulation networks, signal transduction networks, protein interaction networks, and more. This introductory course covers some basic network measures, models, and processes that unfold on networks. The covered material applies to a wide range of networks, but we will focus on social and biological networks. To analyze and model networks, we will learn the basics of the Python programming language and its NetworkX module.The course contains a number of hands-on computer lab sessions. There are five homework assignments and four reading assignments that will be discussed in class.

Multimedia Experimental Theatre and Performance,"(Taught by Visiting Associate Professor Magda Romanska.) With Netflix, YouTube and other Internet services providing any type of entertainment on demand, in the privacy of one&#39;s own home, the ritual of going to see a live performance is becoming increasingly endangered. At the same time as our social and cultural habits are changing, the digital, new-media revolution is also changing the theatre-making process, accelerating the transformation towards non-linear, non-narrative, immersive theatrical experience that is increasingly reflective of a fragmented global cultural landscape and its audiences. As Robert Lepage put it: &quot;We are confronted with audiences whose narrative vocabulary has evolved. . . They can read stories backwards now, and jump cut, and can flash forward.&quot; The Multimedia Experimental Theatre workshop-style course will focus on multimedia theatre as symptomatic of postmodern &quot;disintegration of meaning&quot; of words, and concepts. The students will explore new ways of analyzing and developing multimedia narratives that move across different genres, incorporating both film, video and live performance. They will also map their own non-linear narratives based on found multimedia, classic texts and their own writing.",499,TDM 169DA,13036
Live Art in the Theater Environment,"(Taught by Visiting Lecturer Dean Moss.) A fast-paced intensive introduction to multidisciplinary performance art practice. Open to a mix of students with dance, visual, video, and/or theatrical backgrounds, the course will focus on practical strategies employed in the blending of movement, sound, image, and presence in contemporary performance works. Students will use themselves, each other, the immediate environment, and an assortment of media production tools, to embody alternative, non-traditional theater processes and create multidisciplinary performance art projects. Discussion, screenings and reading assignments will provide conceptual and historical context for the course.",499,TDM 169DB,13822
"Argentine Tango: Culture, Music, and the Dance","A thorough introduction to, and immersion in, the culture and history, music and dance, of one of Latin America&#39;s richest art forms, tango argentino. This course, taught by Thomas Wisniewski, a professionally trained musician and dancer, will combine academic work with studio training and offer an interdisciplinary and comparative study of both theory and practice. Throughout the semester, we will analyze tango music, films, and literature from the early twentieth century to the present day. Weekly lessons will provide a progressive introduction to the dance. Students\nwill learn tango by studying it and by doing it, as they engage regularly in critical and creative work drawing on both mind and body.",499,TDM 149DA,13611
What's so Funny?: Introduction to Improvisational Comedy,"Comedy has often been thought of as the poor relation to Drama but, as Lenny Bruce said, &quot;the only honest art form is comedy because you can&#39;t fake it.&quot; We will attempt to take comedy seriously by studying its component parts and engaging in committed, creative and collaborative &quot;play&quot; that will tap into each student&#39;s personal, individual sense of humor. The class will focus on the basics of improvisation: group games, narrative skills, patterns, offers, spontaneity, agreement, using the space around you, building on-stage relationships and, eventually, scene work.",499,TDM 120,13769
Computational Cognitive Neuroscience: Building Models of the Brain,"&quot;What I cannot create, I do not understand.&quot; This course applies Richard Feynman&#39;s dictum to the brain, by teaching students how to simulate brain function with computer programs. Special emphasis will be placed on how neurobiological mechanisms give rise to cognitive processes like learning, memory, attention, decision-making, and object perception. Students will learn how to understand experimental data through the lens of computational models, and ultimately how to build their own models.",124,PSY 1401,13662
Brain Science for World Leaders,"Three forces have converged to make this the most exciting time for brain science.&nbsp; First, we don&rsquo;t yet understand how the brain works, how it breaks, and how to fix it: we have important questions to answer. Second, a slew of powerful brain methods have emerged and we have entered an era of massive computing power: we have serious tools. Third, more than ever before, there is a social will and now a political mandate to tackle these questions head on: we all want to know more about brains!This course will give you an overview of our current state of brain science knowledge and some basic neuroscience know-how. The content is structured to help you best on that future day when you&rsquo;re an entrepreneur, lawyer, scientist, or the next president, so you&rsquo;ll have the foundation to shape the next decade of brain science discovery and policy.",124,PSY 1301,13787
Evolving Morality: From Primordial Soup to Superintelligent Machines (Grad. Sem. in Gen. Ed.),"Students will help tell the story of morality on Earth, from its origins in the biology of unthinking cooperative organisms, through the psychology of intelligent cooperative primates, and into a future inhabited by machines that may be smarter and more capable than humans. Addressing longstanding philosophical questions in light of new scientific knowledge, this course will integrate material from across the humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and applied sciences with an emphasis on the development of interactive teaching tools.&nbsp;",124,PSY 2250,13733
Psychology of Dominance and Societal Structure,"Humans are social beings. We need to live in groups to survive and flourish. From living in tribes, the vast majority of populations have now developed into modern societies which nevertheless are fortified by social control and dominance.Modern societies differ greatly in how their hierarchies are organized, and how the inevitable group-based inequality is maintained. For instance, Scandinavian countries are often perceived as more egalitarian than the United States, which in turn is seen as more egalitarian than Burundi.In this class we analyze the differing degrees of inequality present within different societies and systematically explore the cultural mechanisms which contribute to the different hierarchies. We will use case studies, from the US, Burundi, and Western and Eastern European countries. We will draw from research in Psychology, Sociology and Political Science to address questions such as, what mechanism consolidate hierarchies? Among others, we will reflect how stereotypes, racism and sexism are used to strengthen existing structures and compare how they appear in different societies. We will ask, what mechanism can foster attitudinal and behavioral changes to overcome inequality and power disparity.In a group-based class project students will develop a research proposal to address how cultures manifest or change their internal structures. This course put a strong emphasis on developing skills for how to conduct stringent empirical research in complex macro-level settings.",124,PSY 980W,13821
Poetry in Flux - Dance Afoot,"This course explores the interchange between dance and poetry in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century culture across a variety of literary traditions: Anglo-American (Pound, Yeats, Eliot); French (Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarm&eacute;); German and Austrian (Trakl, Rilke); Italian (Campana, Marinetti, Soffici); and Spanish (Lorca). How can poetry draw inspiration from dance and use it as a model for formal experimentation? Through a hands-on engagement with a number of seminal texts, students will learn how dance can set words in motion&mdash;and how, conversely, words can deal with the challenge of representing subtle nuances of bodily expression. We&rsquo;ll focus on issues such as musicality and rhythm, free verse, meter and lyricism in poetry; broader attention will be given to inter-artistic borrowings, including synaesthesia (the blending of sensory modalities), ekphrasis (the literary imitation of a visual object), and Gesamtkunstwerk (the drive to achieve a total work of art). The course will feature film screenings (Lo&iuml;e Fuller and Pina Bausch; animation by Oskar Fischinger), guest lectures and visits to Harvard Library collections.",24,COMPLIT 119,13124
Professing Literature 3,This course focuses on professional development and preparation for academic careers in literature and related fields as well as positions outside academe.&nbsp;Part two of a two-part series.

"Groups and Networks: How Others Shape our Behavior, Beliefs, and Motivations","We are an intensely social species. We have vast and complex social networks, connect with strangers for common goals, and gain a sense of identity through our &quot;in group.&quot; Understanding the human mind therefore means understanding how we influence and are influenced by the larger social web around us. In this course, we will examine empirical research that reveals how groups work -- how they can make us smarter or dumber, how we form social bonds, how the making of &quot;us&quot; also means the making of &quot;them,&quot; and how our social networks transmit everything from democracy to disease.",124,PSY 1506,13224
Music and the Mind,"Music is universal, pervasive in our everyday lives, and compelling. How does music make our emotions soar, spark our creativity, and influence our relationships and interactions with others? This course will examine how the brain creates and experiences music, how music in turn shapes our brains and tunes our ability to engage with our external environment, and what music reveals about the ability of the human brain to co-opt evolutionarily ancient mechanisms for seemingly &quot;unique&quot; human faculties. We will cover the relationship between music and emotions, movement, creativity, and sociality.",124,PSY 1057,13642
Social Synchrony: On the Same Wavelength,"Everyone longs for deep connection with others. But is connection more than a feeling? Common expressions describe social connection as being &quot;on the same wavelength&quot;, &quot;marching to the same beat&quot;, or becoming &quot;one&quot; with another person. This course will examine the ways in which these expressions are grounded in biological truth. We will cover topics such as: how do we synchronize our brains and bodies with others in our social environment, and what do these concordances reveal about the quality of our relationships? We will also examine how rapport can be reverse-engineered by manipulating synchrony in surprisingly simple ways.",124,PSY 1554,13740
Object Representation in the Mind and Brain,"How does our visual system translate complex arrays of visual inputs into meaningful objects that we can act upon? What do we need to construct a sound theory of object representation? What progress have researchers made in understanding this process over the past few decades? What information is essential and where is it computed and represented in the human brain? In this seminar, we will address these questions by reading and discussing key papers on object representation, critically evaluating results from behavioral, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, special population (e.g., blind individuals), neuroimaging, and computational studies. This seminar will not only provide a critical review of the current literature, but also identify important challenges that await future research.",124,PSY 2320,13742
Mind Reading,"Mind reading is not the stuff of science fiction, is it a complex set of mental processes honed throughout our evolutionary history that allow us to survive and thrive in a social world. But what is a mind? Who has one? Can we ever know what is in the minds of others? In this course we will attempt to answer these questions by exploring how the human mind uses perceptual information to infer other peoples&rsquo; thoughts, beliefs, and desires. Our goal will be to critically examine why people succeed and fail at reading others&rsquo; minds",124,PSY 1562,13331
Predicting the Future,"Although converging evidence suggests that our brains are virtuoso predictors at the millisecond time-scale, people have a great deal of trouble simulating their future states. Why is it that we are so good at short-term predictions but fail to know how long it will take us to complete assignments, how embarrassing we&rsquo;ll find our high school yearbook quotes, or how happy our choices will make us? This course attempts to answer these questions by examining prospection, our ability to simulate the future. Particular attention will be paid to systematic ways in which our predictions about the future go awry.",124,PSY 1563,13643
Decision Making and Negotiation,"Decision-Making and NegotiationPeople make decisions and negotiate with others from a young age; however, most know little about the strategy and the psychology that lie beneath these sophisticated behaviors. This class is designed to look &lsquo;under the hood&rsquo; at the cognitive processes at play when we make decisions and negotiate with others. We will discuss original research articles and use simulated class exercises to gain a better understanding of how the human mind makes choices and persuades others.",124,PSY 1500,13709
Musicology Special Topics,"Sound Studies and Instrumentality.&nbsp; This seminar will explore transforming notions of instrumentality, considering the role of instruments (defined broadly) within music and in broader technological contexts. We will consider both the history of instrumentality and what instrumentality means today in light of the proliferation of digital technologies. This seminar will be taught in collaboration with a mirror seminar at McGill, led by Jonathan Sterne. We will meet jointly&mdash;digitally&mdash;regularly throughout the semester and students in both seminars will work collaboratively throughout the semester, all the while reflecting thoughtfully on the tools and technologies that enable these sorts of interactions",99,MUSIC 241R,13504
In Search of the Perfect School,"Is there a formula for the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; school? Guided by this overarching question, you will critically analyze and creatively integrate theory, research, and policy with a particular focus on the application of educational psychology in secondary school. This focus serves as a window into many of the most topical and interesting issues facing our students and schools.",124,PSY 1055,13015
Self Regulation and the Pursuit of Personal Goals,"Have you ever abandoned a New Year&rsquo;s resolution? Do you find yourself flipping through Facebook as a final exam nears? These common experiences can be explained by self-regulation, an exciting yet elusive construct that has captured the attention of researchers across psychology. In this course, students will explore the widespread influence of self-regulation through diverse scholarly sources accompanied by spirited discussion. Spanning several subdisciplines of psychology to address its hottest topics from the theoretical and empirical lens of self-regulation, we will divide the course by its many domains of practical relevance (e.g., behavior, emotion, learning) and apply them to students&rsquo; own lives.",124,PSY 1557,13710
Scientific Biographies,"Scientific Biography is a genre with a history. A history, in fact, that can teach us a lot about how our view of science and knowledge and truth and art have changed over time, ever since the Greeks. In this course, we will be reading biographies of scientists from different fields - physics, mathematics, biology, geology, astronomy, medicine &ndash; and different historical times, closely examining both the art and craft of biography, as well as its changing historical contexts. Some of the characters we will meet include Pythagoras, Descartes, Galileo, Darwin, Einstein, Marie and Pierre Curie, Barbara McClintock, and George Price. Using literature, plays, film, and art - we will see how biographies of scientists have evolved, and continue to change dramatically, and why that&rsquo;s meaningful and important. But the course will also deal with biographies of a different kind &ndash; of ideas, objects, diseases, even equations. Here we&rsquo;ll encounter, among others, Lonesome George the Galapagos turtle, E=mc2, H2O, and cancer. Using literary, philosophical, scientific, and historical analysis, we&rsquo;ll ask how the evolution of the genre of scientific biography can be used as a prism to understand broad developments in the sciences themselves, as well as in the history of science as a discipline.",76,HISTSCI 295V,13106
Programming I,"Introduces general computer programming to students with little prior programming experiences. Taught in a computing lab, the course consists of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on exercises. Example topics include language syntax, flow control, and basic data structures.",13,BIOSTAT 273,13105
The Transformation of Marketing,"Marketing is the process by which an organization creates value for customers and extracts a share of that value for the organization. The seminar will cover the basics of marketing management and explore how the advent of new digital technologies, the increasingly global nature of business, and recent societal trends are impacting the marketing field. The seminar draws upon concepts in psychology, sociology and economics and infuses many examples to illustrate relevant issues. Each meeting covers a specific topic, with pre-readings forming the basis for in-class discussion. There will be two short assignments during the term and one final paper.",56,FRSEMR 40D,13541
"World Literature, Postcolonial Studies, Francophonie and Creolization: Reading in Context",This course provides an overview of major trends in Francophone and postcolonial studies thatcorrelate with the field of world literature/litt&eacute;rature-monde.,126,FRENCH 176,13006
Economic History of India,"The economic transformation of India over the past two decades has been dramatic. The contradictions of this transformation&mdash;the juxtaposition of new wealth and enduring poverty&mdash;are rooted in the region&rsquo;s economic history. This research seminar explores many dimensions of economic life in colonial and post-colonial India. Topics include: the history of markets and commodities, property and labor; the history of economic ideas in India; the changing nature of economic and social inequality; and the close relationship between economic and cultural change. Students will write a substantial research paper using primary sources.",141,SAS 130,13003
South Asia: A Global History,"This course provides a global perspective on modern South Asia, from the early twentieth century to the present day. It examines how South Asia has shaped the world, and how the world has shaped South Asia. Topics covered will include: the Indian freedom movement in global perspective; the migration and settlement of South Asian communities overseas; conflict and cooperation between South Asia&rsquo;s states&mdash; India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka&mdash;and relations between South Asia, China and the United States. We will also examine the centrality of South Asia to the successes and failures of schemes of international health and development, and to global environmental politics in the twenty first century.",141,SAS 131,13452
Environmental History of South Asia,"This seminar explores approaches to the environmental history of modern South Asia. It is designed for graduate students preparing examination fields in Modern and Contemporary South Asian Studies and in South Asian History; it might also be of interest as a comparative perspective for those specializing in the environmental history of other parts of the world. Topics and readings will be tailored to students&rsquo; individual interests, but are likely to include: changing human interactions with the natural environment; the role of colonial and post-colonial states in environmental transformation; and the development of Indian environmental law and regulation.",141,SAS 230,12955
Venice,"Undergraduate colloquium/conference course on the architectural and urban history of Venice from the origins to the end of the Republic, with emphasis on the basilica of San Marco, the mendicant churches and tombs, medieval and Renaissance palaces, and the villas and churches of Palladio, including those in Vicenza and the Veneto. Some coverage of the major Renaissance artists: Mantegna, the Bellini, and Titian, and an introduction to the criticism of Ruskin. Weekly lecture plus frequent student reports.",75,HAA 151V,13797
Explaining Academic Achievement,"Is there a formula for academic success? Would it be the same for every student? Guided by these overarching questions, we will survey some of the most interesting and important factors that facilitate achievement during different stages of formal schooling. You will be introduced to the theoretical roots, empirical evidence, and practical implications of these factors as we integrate them throughout the semester to create an equation that attempts to explain academic achievement.",124,PSY 1056,13422
Contemporary Architecture and Critical Debates,"Investigates architecture circa the 1960s to the present, focusing on such issues as the afterlife of modernism, the impact of globalization, and the spectacularization of culture in our time. Topics include: architecture and the visual culture of catastrophe, discourses on postmodernism, architecture&rsquo;s relationship to &ldquo;Reaganomics,&rdquo; &ldquo;fractal&rdquo; sensibilities, architecture as the subject of contemporary art and exhibitions, the significance of Berlin, and the socio-cultural and political ramifications of the destruction of the World Trade Center.",75,HAA 171V,13574
"World War I in Fiction, Film, Poetry, and Memoir","On the centenary of WWI, this seminar will explore a wide range of representations of the conflict that began in the Balkans but swept through Europe to the Middle East and Russia, to the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, to the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black Seas, and drew in soldiers and civilians from Africa, Asia, and the Americas. By looking closely at materials across genres and cultural forms, we will examine the contradictions and contingencies of the war that set the stage for a century of political, social, and cultural history.",73,HIST-LIT 90BX,13031
Cold War Cinema,This course examines the history of the United States and the Cold War using popular films made during the conflict as the principal texts. The class is divided into two units -- the first looks at the effects of the &quot;Red Scare&quot; on culture and politics in the United States from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. The second section examines U.S. interventions in the &quot;Third World&quot; from the 1950s to the 1980s and their influences both on countries from Algeria to Afghanistan and domestically.,73,HIST-LIT 90BY,13399
"Harvard, Meritocracy, and the Making of Elites","The belief that resources such as education and rewards such as high pay should go to the meritorious is so deeply ingrained in our culture that it provides much of the basic logic and vocabulary for making sense of inequality and hierarchy in everyday life. This course historicizes meritocracy as an ideal and practice by focusing on Harvard University since the Civil War. Throughout this period, Harvard has seen its role as training a meritorious elite to lead society. We will study the historical politics of this elitism in the context of class, race, gender, capitalism, and mass democracy.",73,HIST-LIT 90BZ,12953
Cocaine: Customs and War in the Americas,"No Latin American commodity produced in the last century has been as destructive as cocaine. No other substance has drawn as much attention from scholars, journalists, filmmakers and state agencies. In this seminar, students will look at a variety of primary and secondary sources: accounts of historians, anthropologists, filmmakers, witnesses and survivors. We will ask questions about the content of these texts and look at their form, while also thinking about their audiences, their genres and ideologies. Doing so will enable us to gain a new understanding of the U.S. and Latin America, and to reevaluate the relationship between them.",73,HIST-LIT 90CA,13145
"Abstract Thought in Non-Human Animals, Human Infants, Young Children, and Human Adults","A scientific account of human concepts and conceptual development must characterize the content, format, and functional roles of both the innate and the mature conceptual repertoire, as well as the developmental processes that operate on the former to produce the latter.&nbsp; The evidence for innate sensory, perceptual, and motor representations is overwhelming; much recent work has provided evidence for richer primitives with content such as agent and object as well.&nbsp; But the adult conceptual repertoire includes explicit abstract concepts supporting natural language, spatial symbols, mathematics and logic.&nbsp; We will provide evidence for innate content in each of these domains, and explore the hypotheses that the representational systems that express that content nonetheless are qualitatively different from those that are realized in the adult state.&nbsp; These issues will be explored in three case studies:&nbsp; representations of number, geometry, and of logical connectives and abstract relations.&nbsp; The seminar will consider proposals from linguistics, philosophy, and cognitive science concerning the combinatorial resources of natural language, and will ask whether these resources are qualitatively different from those that articulate perception and action, and if so, whether they arise in human evolution only with the evolution of language, and in human development only in the course of language acquisition.",124,PSY 2152,13270
Early American Environments,"This course explores the multiple meanings of North America&rsquo;s wild areas to its early American denizens by studying the fictional and nonfictional texts these landscapes have inspired. By studying writers from different social classes (from statesmen to enslaved people), we will pay particular attention to the role a writer&rsquo;s social position played in the way she/he responded to and wrote about the American wilderness. We will pose these questions to a range of early American genres&mdash;sermons, memoirs, natural histories, novels, and newspapers&mdash;as we seek to understand the manifold and conflicting meanings of the &ldquo;central fact&rdquo; of American experience.",73,HIST-LIT 90CB,13484
"Boundaries, Borders, Bodies","Border geographies and urban boundaries delimit the terms of identity, reinforcing the notion of the city-state with material conditions and force. Such demarcations throw light on basic understandings of inclusion and exclusion, and how &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; are defined along the course of time. They are often in subtle or outright conflict with concurrent notions of selfhood, property, freedom, and mobility associated with modern life. The course traces along zones of passage that limit, regulate, and control mobility (including frontiers, enclosures, walls, barbed wire, among others) and theories of the distribution of the sensible (including security, circulation, mobility, flow, etc.). The course doubles as an arts practicum whereby students will engage weekly with works of art relating to the course themes, and create their own artwork with material guidance.",73,HIST-LIT 90CC,13686
Multilevel and Longitudinal Models,"Data often have structure that needs to be modeled explicitly. For example, when investigating students&#39; outcomes we need to account for the fact that students are nested inside classes that are in turn nested inside schools. If we are watching students develop over time, we need to account for the dependence of measurements across time. If we do not, our inferences will tend to be overly optimistic and wrong. The course provides an overall framework, the multilevel and generalized multilevel (hierarchical) model, for thinking about and analyzing these forms of data. We will focus on specific versions of these tools for the most common forms of longitudinal and clustered data. This course will focus on applied work, using real data sets and the statistical software R. R will be specifically taught and supported. While the primary focus will be on the linear model with continuous outcomes (i.e., the classic regression framework) we will also discuss binary, categorical, and ordinal outcomes. We will emphasize how to think about the applicability of these methods, how they might fail, and what one might do to protect oneself in such circumstances. Applications of hierarchical (multi-level) models will include the canonical specific cases of random-slope, random-intercept, mixed effect, crossed effect, marginal, and growth-curve models.",147,STAT 151,13055
Psychological Science Seminar,"An introduction to the sciences of mind, including foundational concepts from neuroscience, evolution, genetics, philosophy, and experimental methods, and specific topics such as perception, memory, reasoning and decision-making, consciousness, child development, psychopathology, personality, language, emotion, sexuality, violence, morality and social relations.",61,SCILIVSY 20S,13365
Game Theory and Social Behavior,"We will apply an evolutionary framework - with the help of models from &quot;game theory&quot; and &quot;evolutionary dynamics&quot; - to explain social behavior typically considered the realm of psychologists and philosophers, such as why we speak indirectly, in what sense beauty is socially constructed, and where our moral intuitions come from.Game theory and evolutionary dynamics will be taught from scratch but will not be redundant to experienced students. Five problem sets will be required, which can be done in groups and will require basic programming and math. Tutorials will be available for students in need of additional assistance. Weekly readings will be assigned from various related disciplines, such as psychology, philosophy, economics, and animal behavior. The readings will help students answer weekly discussion prompts which will be discussed in weekly discussion sections. Students will also work on a final project (n groups, if desired) that advances either the theoretical or empirical component of the course material.",78,HEB 1390,13402
Devotional Poetry,"In this workshop we will focus on the devotional poetry of John Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, and GM Hopkins, looking first into certain texts of the Old Testament&mdash;Psalms, Song of Solomon, Book of Job&mdash;from which so much of devotional poetry extends. In conversation with these four poets, students can expect to build and execute their own plaintive lyric &ldquo;I,&rdquo; design new ecstatic/meditative soundscape, and plan and deliver the imagistic configurations that will best give them direct-line access to the God (or gods) of their own choice or invention.&nbsp;As this a poetry workshop, all assignments will be creative.",52,ENGLISH CDPR,13550
Special Topics in Condensed Matter Physics. Quantum Many-Body Systems,"This course will review field theory methods and Green&#39;s function approach to quantum many-body systems. Subjects discussed will include interacting electron systems, electron-phonon interaction and superconductivity, polarons, systems with dissipation, nonequilibrium phenomena and Keldysh Green&#39;s functions.",123,PHYSICS 268BR,13580

Caribbean Poetics,"This course examines influential works of &ldquo;Caribbean Poetics&rdquo; from a literary, philosophical, and political perspective. It explores the distinctiveness of this literary tradition and its contributions to thinking about race, colonialism, language and the sacred. Readings will include &Eacute;douard Glissant, Derek Walcott, and Edwidge Danticat, among others. Jointly offered in Harvard Divinity School as HDS 2430.",504,EMR 122,13578
Hagia Sophia: Space and Ceremony,"This course will look into the history of construction and embellishment of Hagia Sophia, built by Justinian in the 6th century. &nbsp;This extraordinary building, with its dome and open spatial interior stood as a marvel of architecture throughout the middle ages. &nbsp;In this great space, many rituals and ceremonies took place, which will also be studied during the semester.",75,HAA 144M,13586
Functional Neuroimaging of Psychiatric Disorders: Insights into the Human Brain-Mind,"Functional brain imaging has revolutionized the study of systems-level behavioral neuroscience and psychiatric disorders, through the ability to localize and characterize distributed brain activity directly associated with perception, cognition, emotion and behavior in disorders where there are not gross brain lesions.&nbsp; This seminar will introduce students to translational neuroimaging methods at the interface of neuroscience, psychology and medicine.&nbsp; It will cover recent and ongoing advances in our understanding of fronto-limbic-subcortical brain circuitry across the range of psychiatric disorders (e.g. mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, personality disorders, addictions).&nbsp; It will discuss new, emerging biological (as opposed to descriptive) taxonomies and conceptualizations of mental illness and its treatment.&nbsp; It will explore the implications of such knowledge for issues such as consciousness, meaning, free will, emotion, resilience, and religiosity.&nbsp; It will incorporate clinical observations, scientific data and readings, and examine future directions in brain-mind medicine.",97,MBB 980M,13582
"South Asia: Connected Histories, Interdisciplinary Frames","This course will proceed chronologically beginning with the period before colonial rule in order to trace linkages and ruptures in ideas about South Asia over time. We will focus on notions of place and identity&mdash;and their contestations&mdash;as the subcontinent experienced the shift from early modern forms of empire to colonial rule to anti-colonial and nationalist movements, and, more recently, new geopolitical configurations characterized by financial globalization, the &ldquo;rise of Asia&rdquo; and increased levels of migration. Readings will draw from anthropology, history, literary studies, political science, religious studies, and excerpts from primary sources.",141,SAS 179,13348
Introduction to Quantitative Microscopy & Image Analysis,"When used properly, quantitative optical microscopy and computational image analysis are powerful tools for exploratory and mechanistic investigations of molecular and cellular processes. This quarter course is an introduction to experimental design and best practices for using optical microscopy techniques (fluorescence, confocal, TIRF, super-resolution, light sheet microscopy) and computational methods (image segmentation, filtering, object detection, tracking, image-derived data analysis, etc.) in cell biology research.&nbsp; An emphasis is placed on making accurate and precise quantitative measurements from optical microscopy images.",84,CELLBIO 313QC,13247
Understanding Altruism,"People give a lot: 2% of GDP is donated to charity, 2-4% of hours worked are volunteered, and 50% of Americans vote in National Elections. Yet such giving displays puzzling qualities: for example, giving is often inefficient (consider the efficiency of Habitat for Humanity) and people who would otherwise give will pay to opt out of being solicited.We use simple game theory models, combined with models of evolution and evidence from experimental economics papers, to better understand our altruistic preferences and their puzzling qualities.&nbsp; In doing so, we gain insight on how to promote more effective giving (should contributions be observable?) and better policy (should the law distinguish between crimes of omission and commission?).Through the readings, students will gain exposure to relevant literatures in experimental economics, as well as evolutionary biology and social psychology. Students will gain a facility with lab and field experimental methods, as well as the relevant game theory and dynamic models. The class is primarily discussion based; students are expected to read and be prepared to discuss cutting edge research papers each class.&nbsp; There will also be 2-3 problem sets over the course of the semester, and 2-3 writing assignments, including a final project in which students are required to design original research.This class is a particularly good fit for: students wishing to launch or join non-profits and socially responsible businesses; those who have an interest in politics or policy; and, those wishing to do research--especially experimental or behavioral--related to charity or altruism, perhaps in preparation for their honors theses.",45,ECON 1053,13246
How To Do Things With Grammar: The Poet in Love and War,"In every language the linguistic order known as grammar uses its forms and means of linkage to identify speakers and listeners, situate them in the world of things and time, signal agency and passivity, legislate relationships of power and subjugation. Through close readings, translation, imitation and recitation of masterpieces of classic and contemporary Spanish and Latin American poetry, we examine how poets use and abuse grammatical rules, stretching the capacity of their language to express desire, nostalgia, regret or dread, utter and question truths; speak for themselves and their communities.&nbsp; The course features detailed grammar study, theoretical readings, intensive writing practice and opportunities for creative work.",132,SPANSH 80GR,13585
Law and Society through the Cinematic Frame,"In this seminar we will explore the interaction of law and society using the lens of film. The cinematic experience has become a key site through which the public understanding of law is produced, debated and influenced. Driven first and foremost by market and audience considerations, law related films often inject drama, contentious dimensions and even misrepresentations into the portrayal of real events. Nonetheless, by raising awareness about legal themes that pervade the plot, these films offer valuable insights toward discovering social scientific perspectives on the manner in which law functions in everyday life. Hence, the seminar will not focus on legal doctrine or teach you the fundamentals of the legal profession. Rather, using films as a framework for discussion, we will study law&rsquo;s working in relations to the social, political, economic and cultural environments in which it operates. Central thematic topics to be discussed include: the relationship between law, justice and morality; how does law intervenes in social relations and whether it is over-utilized as part of these relations; the dynamics between law and social change; is access to the legal process equal to everyone; and the function of law in deeply divided societies. Throughout the semester film viewing will occur outside class as part of your weekly preparation for the seminar. However, we will dedicate one class as a field trip to watch a law-related film together and analyze its themes through the sociolegal perspective.",56,FRSEMR 40E,13549
"Contagion Narratives: Plagues, Fevers, and Outbreaks in Fiction from Defoe to Camus","This course examines narratives about contagious diseases that have threatened global health from the seventeenth century to the present-plague, smallpox, yellow fever, tuberculosis, influenza, and others. We will read novels and short stories by Defoe, Hawthorne, Maupassant, Gaskell, James, Chekhov, Stoker, Katherine Anne Porter, Camus and other writers who explored the physical, social, and psychological effects of contagion in their fiction. Along the way, we will chart the history of epidemiology and germ theory, considering how the expansion of biomedical knowledge gave rise to innovations in narrative form.",52,ENGLISH 190C,13350
Nineteenth-Century Women Writers,"This seminar explores nineteenth-century writing by British, Caribbean, and South African women who explored a variety of contemporary problems including the woman question, courtship and marriage practices, sexuality and reproduction, racial politics, the institution of slavery, and colonial occupation. We will read novels by Mary Shelley, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bront&euml;, Elizabeth Gaskell, M.E. Braddon, and Olive Schreiner, and shorter works by Mary Prince, George Eliot, Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale, Christina Rossetti, and others.

In this course, we study a variety of optimization algorithms for designing and stabilizing trajectories for walking, manipulating, and flying systems. Topics will include optimal control (HJB and Pontryagin&rsquo;s minimum principle), nonlinear optimization, trajectory planning (shooting and direct methods) and stabilization, model-predictive control, legged systems (classical models, humanoids, centriodal dynamics), convex methods for control and stability analysis, and optimization through frictional contact. Students will gain practical experience implementing modern algorithms to control a variety of simulated systems using the Drake software toolbox.**http://drake.mit.edu",50,COMPSCI 284,13914
Archaeology and Heritage,"The links between archaeology, cultural heritage, and nation building have been fundamentally important to archaeological practice since the origins of the discipline. The uses and abuses of archaeology by the state over the past fifty years have been criticized by all manner of social scientists, journalists, local communities and indigenous people in countries across the globe, in dozens of books, hundreds of articles, and The International Journal of Heritage Studies. Archaeological practice and heritage management continue to be the topic of lively theoretical and legal debates by multiple stakeholders with competing claims to the past. The ideological uses and commodification of archaeological heritage by diverse factions has led many archaeologists to become actively involved in creating sustainable solutions that promote responsible heritage stewardship in this dynamic context. The members of the seminar will read and discuss theoretical schema, practice and critiques from the Americas and the Old World in examining innovative approaches to archaeological heritage management. The focus in this seminar will be on finding a &lsquo;third way&rsquo; to address the valid claims of local communities and indigenous peoples, vis-&agrave;-vis the ways central governments construct their own origin myths and legitimation of the state through archaeological research and its presentation to the public.",6,ANTHRO 2211,13903
The Short Screenplay: Workshop,"This class introduces the short screenplay -anywhere from one to thirty formatted pages. Students will learn the basics of this challenging form by viewing short films and reading short screenplays, short stories, and short creative essays.We&#39;ll focus on character and plot in the scripts we develop because many short films-even highly lauded ones-are lacking in these areas. The goal of the course is to write scripts that can actually be produced, so we&#39;ll also consider budgetary matters when we&#39;re writing.Prior screenwriting experience is required.",52,ENGLISH CSSR,13904
Red Tape: Bureaucracy in American Culture,"Bureaucracy is boring. And yet, its dreary routines and million petty frustrations have inspired some of the most interesting art and thought of the past two centuries. Where did bureaucracy come from, and why has it proved such a persistent object of fascination, particularly in the U.S.? How have bureaucratic institutions (government agencies, the modern corporation, etc.) shaped culture, and how have cultural objects shaped our ideas about bureaucracy? Readings from Melville, Weber, Orwell, Arendt, and Foucault; films include The Apartment, Die Hard, and Contagion.",73,HIST-LIT 90CD,13916
"Cultures of Health and Healing: Religion, Medicine, and Global Health","What does it mean to &ldquo;be healthy&rdquo; and &ldquo;to heal&rdquo; in different contexts? What sorts of medical, ritual, or religious expertise authorizes different sorts of healers and forms of healing? What conceptions of human bodies and their capabilities are assumed? These questions probe entanglements of religion and medicine in everyday life. This course focuses on ways in which these issues might inform, challenge, and enrich thinking about global health. We will examine moral and religious histories of the global health movement alongside pressing contemporary questions such as, how do disease epidemics shape religious practice? How does religious belief shape the reception of biomedical technologies? We will consider examples from a range of contexts and traditions. Topics include colonialism, medical missionaries, social gospel and public health, human rights, bioethics, and liberation theology. Throughout the course, we will discuss the relevance of socio-economics, race, gender, and sexuality.",160,RELIGION 111,13920

U.S. Foreign Policy in a Global Age,"The United States is the most powerful player on the international scene today, and is unlikely to relinquish that position any time soon.Ã_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÃ_ Understanding how and why this condition arose, and what it means for world affairs today, is our concern in this course.Ã_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÃ_ The emphasis is on U.S. policymaking over the past century, with due attention to the international and domestic political context in which decisions were made.Ã_Â€Ã_Ã__Ã_Â‰ÂŒÃ_ Issues to be explored include the tension between isolationism and interventionism and between unilateralism and multilateralism; the emergence of the U.S. as a superpower; the Soviet-American confrontation; the rise of presidential power in foreign affairs; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the nature of American power in today&rsquo;s world.",72,HIST 1217,13944
Soundtracking,"This course will offer a critical, close-reading approach and a creative art-making approach to exploring ways of combining sound and moving image. The first few weeks will involve analysis and discussion of uses of music/sound in excerpts from a variety of movies and TV series episodes and mastering skills for working with ProTools, a digital audio workstation system that can incorporate video. As skills with Pro Tools develop emphasis will shift to composition exercises that experiment with combining sound and image. Since all students will be given the same assignments we will have the opportunity of testing and discussing various solutions. The seminar will accept students with and without compositional training and the ability to notate music. Sound will be composed in various ways, many of which will not involve conventional music notation. All students will learn to use high quality field recorders to gather sound materials that can then be sculpted with Pro Tools. The final project will be the production of a sound track to an assigned short film (5-10 minutes) and a public screening.",56,FRSEMR 35C,13978
Sex and Ethical Reasoning,"&ldquo;Immorality&rdquo; once meant sexual misconduct, especially by women. Now many people are unclear whether ethics can say anything convincing about sex at all. Such rapid change in ethical views makes sex a very good place to think about how ethical reasoning develops and how it might matter to our lives. We will study the historical shifts and current ranges of some American controversies about sex, including sexual identity, rape or assault, adultery or polyamory, prostitution, pornography, and online sex. You will then be encouraged to use these cases to clarify and critique your own sexual ethics.",60,ETHRSON 42,13939
The Mouse in Science and Society,"Mice remain the most popular vertebrates used in biomedical R&amp;D today, with tens of millions of lab mice produced annually in the United States alone. At the same time, mice are commonly studied for their own characteristics that continue to enhance our knowledge about innate mammalian behavior, predatorÃ_Â€ÂŒÂ¢Ã_Â‰Ã_Â‰Ã¥Ã_Â‰ÂŒÂêprey dynamics in changing ecosystems, and reservoir hosts for emerging diseases, to name a few.&nbsp; This course intends to provide a strong foundation in mouse biology, both basic and applied, as well as exposure to cultural and political aspects of the current impact of mice (real or fictitious) on contemporary societal values.&nbsp; Instructors:&nbsp; Steven M.

Is Democracy History or Destiny?,"Democratic theory and practice emerged in specific historical circumstances.&nbsp; Those circumstances no longer exist, even in the countries where democratic government is most securely established.&nbsp; What then is democracy&#39;s future?&nbsp; Is it history?&nbsp; Will China be democratic in fifty years?&nbsp; Will Egypt?&nbsp; Will the US?&nbsp; On what foundations does democratic government rest?&nbsp; How can we think intelligently about democracy&#39;s recurrent crises and the enormous challenges of democratization?",70,GOV 94AH,13941
"Shipwrecks and Seafarers, Piracy and Plundering: An Introduction to Maritime Archaeology","Shipwrecks, piracy, naval battles: the phrase &ldquo;maritime archaeology&rdquo; often conjures up images both romantic and violent as we envision a ship lying on its side, a gaping hole in its hull, at the bottom of a dark, murky ocean. While this image is only rarely an accurate representation of the scene, maritime archaeologists use the information from shipwrecks, submerged settlements, cargo deposits, wharves and other shoreline sites to piece together a story about the people who sailed the ships, built them, loaded their cargo, and much more. In doing so we give a voice to the often undocumented, silent majority: the sailors, laborers, passengers, and shipwrights who speak to us only through the artifacts they left behind.This class will introduce the field of maritime archaeology, including its history, procedures, and the information we can learn from both a sunken vessel and the artifact assemblages from a maritime site. Students will have the opportunity to have a hands-on experience using a remote-operated vehicle (ROV), and we are planning to visit an active local shoreline excavation site. We will also use museum collections on shipbuilding and maritime culture to learn more about different seafaring traditions. In looking at examples from excavations throughout the world, we will discover more details about those storybook images of shipwrecks, pirates, and seafarers, and understand how to better interpret what they have left for us to find.",6,ANTHRO 1218,13984
"From Cells to Tissues, in Sickness and in Health","Every cell is a part of a larger &ldquo;community&rdquo;, working together to enable tissue function. This course will explore the principles of building complex tissues from cells. How do cells know what tissues to make and when to make them? How do cells communicate with one another? What diseases can arise when these principles go awry? How can we build tissues in the lab? In addition to lectures, students will engage deeply in primary literature.",148,SCRB 145,14002
"Muslim Devotional Literatures in South Asia:  Qawwalis, Sufiana Kalam (Sufi Poetry) and the Ginans","This course explores traditions of Islamic spirituality in South Asia through the lens of three genres: the qawwali, concerts of mystical poetry;&nbsp; sufiana kalam, Sufi romantic epics and folk poems; and the ginans, hymns of esoteric wisdom recited by the Satpanthi Ismailis. Since these genres represent examples of language, symbols and styles of worship shared across Islamic and non-Islamic denominational boundaries, we will also examine their relationships with other Indic traditions of devotion, particularly those associated with the so-called sant and Hindu bhakti movements. Special emphasis will be given to the impact of contemporary political ideologies, globalization and the revolution in media technology on the form and function of these genres and their relationship with contemporary communities of faith in South Asia and beyond.",160,RELIGION 1814,13993
Mechanisms of Life History Evolution,"This seminar will focus on the mechanisms - hormonal, genetic, social, developmental, epistatic, etc. - that underlie life history variation and life history evolution. The taxonomic focus will be very broad, including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates other than primates, as well as human and non-human primates.The course will consist of weekly readings and discussion, as well as a term paper.",78,HEB 2310,13947
Women and Magazines,"Vogue, Ms., Cosmopolitan, Working Mother&ndash; a visit to any newsstand or supermarket checkout line reveals countless magazines, with vastly different aims and content, intended primarily for women. This course explores the complex relationship between women&mdash;as authors, reviewers, readers, and consumers&mdash; and periodicals, beginning in the eighteenth century, when rising literacy rates ad advances in printing technology saw a huge rise in magazine circulation. Then, as now, magazines provided a platform for many women to share their writing; they also, however, often perpetuated problematic gender stereotypes and derogatory images of women. We will read pieces by and about important women writers, including Eliza Haywood, Mary Robinson, and Mary Wollstonecraft, as well as contextualizing materials, to consider questions such as: what differentiates a &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; (or &ldquo;men&rsquo;s&rdquo;) magazine from any other kind of magazine? Are magazines inherently literary, inherently commercial, or both? How do magazines challenge or perpetuate popular discourses about the body? The class will have the opportunity to work with eighteenth- and nineteenth- century magazines in Harvard&rsquo;s special collections, as well as completing research on contemporary magazines. Topics will include: anonymous authorship; travel writing; advertising and consumerism; popular culture; fashion and trends; and the rise of celebrity.",149,WOMGEN 1450,13970
Religion and Politics in Modern America,"This course offers students a panoramic view of the relationship between religion and politics in modern America. The readings include some of the most thought-provoking books on religion and politics published by historians in recent years. Throughout the semester, we will ask how assumptions about the relationship between secularism and pluralism inform our understanding of the grand narrative of modern American religion and politics. Has the twentieth century witnessed the secularization, or &ldquo;de-Christianization,&rdquo; of American politics, or have reports of religion&rsquo;s decline in American public life proved premature? Might we even be seeing a concerted effort to re-Christianize American public culture? If so, will this effort gain momentum from, or run aground on, America&rsquo;s ever-expanding religious diversity? The readings will provide students with a broad overview of the subject area while at the same time inviting them to consider which interpretive approaches they find most compelling and why.",160,RELIGION 1581,13968
Movement Lab,"This course explores the practice of choreography in a dynamic research environment. Students will learn interdisciplinary tools for devising, modifying, and editing motion for the stage, screen or site-specific work. Compositional discernment and keen visual evaluation skills will be developed through: extensive studio practice creating and interpreting movement phrases and gestures; discussion and feedback of individual movement composition assignments; viewing and analyzing the structure, dramaturgy, music, set and lighting design in seminal dance and theater pieces from around the world (e.g. Fabre, Naharin, Jones, Graham, Bausch, Goebbels, Petipa, Pite, Kahn); and examining how new media can be utilized for appraising, capturing and documenting motion in the 21st century.

"Scientific Knowledge, from Certainty to Uncertainty","In 1927, Werner Heisenberg combined certain experimental facts and certain mathematical deductions to analyse atoms. His result was uncertainty, raised to the status of a principle. How did that happen? And how can we locate this moment in a larger historical narrative about the relative status of certain versus uncertain knowledge in science? Topics include the certification of physical knowledge as certain knowledge in the Enlightenment; the mathematicization of biological populations and variations; how uncertainty and randomness were placed at the heart of both; atomic physics and population biology; moral uncertainties and certainties raised by physicists&#39; involvement in the atomic bomb project; and social transformations engendered by life in a world marked, not by certainty but by uncertainty, randomness, and risk.",76,HISTSCI 126V,13954
From Soul to Personality: Religion and Modern Psychology,"Critics and religious adherents alike have used psychology to understand religion for centuries. Some argue that knowledge of the human mind can &ldquo;explain away&rdquo; religion while others argue to the contrary that it buffers religious belief. This course will consider different ways that modern psychology has impacted thinking about religion in the Modern West. We will discuss the rise of empirical psychology, psychoanalysis, new interest in the &ldquo;personality,&rdquo; and the making of a field of the psychology of religion. We will use this historical context to examine recent turns to cognitive science and to &ldquo;Eastern spirituality&rdquo; to understand the relationship between religion and the human mind.",160,RELIGION 53,13971
L'autre Balzac/The Other Balzac,"Behind the better-known Balzac, the realist, the documentarist of everyday life, is the &quot;other&quot; Balzac: the philosopher, the psychopathologist, the writer of dark tales. In this class we will focus on the haunting tales of this lesser-known Balzac.",126,FRENCH 90LB,13965
Gender and Italian Cinema,"From challenging conventional male-female gender dynamics through radical feminist approaches, to juxtaposing narratives of homosexuality and the Holocaust, to toeing the line between fiction and documentary in the representation of transgender romance, Italian cinema has long struggled with contradictions between deeply entrenched gender norms and the populations that they marginalize. This course will explore Italian films that undertake to disrupt traditional notions of gender in Italy.",127,ITAL 119,13979
The Colonial City as Palimpsest,"Through our readings of diaries, satiric and epic poetry, laws and narratives of conquest of the 16th and 17th centuries, we contrast the strategies and tactics for organizing life in the Spanish colonies and the actual practice of living and resisting in three cities of the Viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru: Mexico, Lima and Cuzco.

Borders and Boundaries in International Relations,"This seminar explores the meaning of borders and boundaries in international relations. How do borders, border regions, and border activities speak to national encounters with neighbors and the rest of the world?&nbsp; We will examine the meaning and function of boundary-making between states from multiple perspectives.&nbsp; Borders, border regions and border crossings have multiple significance as designations of state authority, security buffers, expressions of social meaning and opportunities for economic integration.&nbsp; Students will write brief reaction papers and will have the opportunity to participate in faculty research using satellite images and mapping technologies.",70,GOV 94BB,14004

Colonial Departures,"Following World War II, the fabric of European empire in Asia and Africa began to unravel.&nbsp; In some cases through revolutionary violence, in others through diplomatic negotiation, new nations declared themselves free of colonial domination.&nbsp; This course will examine colonialism&rsquo;s 20th century heyday, decline and aftermath from an anthropological perspective, giving particular attention to local decolonizing practices and to the many forms the postcolonial condition may take.",6,ANTHRO 2860,13935
(Mis)Understanding Islam Today,"This course grapples with key controversies &ndash; suicide bombings, blasphemy, gender, Muslim minorities, Islamism &ndash; as a point of entry into understanding Muslim cultures and societies. Drawing on insights from Cultural Anthropology and related fields (Religious Studies, History, Government, Philosophy, Law), the course also encourages self-reflection on our own assumptions regarding religion, secularism, freedom, tolerance and violence. Finally, by dwelling on the case of cross-cultural (mis)understandings related to Islam, the course underscores that no matter what our personal objectives &ndash; social theorizing, developing policy, or being an engaged global citizen &ndash; there is value in understanding how historical and cultural contexts shape us all. No prior familiarity with Islam is required or assumed.",498,HSEMR-LE 75,13980
"Transnationalism and the Francophone World: Race, Gender, Sexuality","This graduate course links different regions of the Francophone world and provides an introduction to the major debates about gender issues in postcolonial Francophone studies. We focus on the aesthetics and politics of writers who challenge the notion of a stable identity, be it national, racial or sexual. The course draws on the historico-cultural issues pertinent to each region (Africa, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean). Writers include Mariama B&acirc; (Senegal), Maryse Cond&eacute; (Guadeloupe/France/USA), Ananda Devi (Mauritius and France), Fatou Diome (Senegal and France), Assia Djebar (Algeria/France/USA), Marie Chauvet (Haiti), Shenaz Patel (Mauritius), and Linda L&ecirc; (Vietnam and France).",126,FRENCH 262,13945

Asteroids and Comets,"Comets have been seen regularly since before the beginning of recorded history. They have oftenbeen regarded as disturbing portents. Asteroids, on the other hand, were not discovered until the 19th century, with the advent of astronomy with telescopes. Today we know of many more asteroids than comets, but we believe that there are vastly more comets than asteroids in the solar system.This seminar will start with the history of the study of comets and asteroids, including the &ldquo;Great March Comet of 1843&rdquo;, observations of which led to the establishment of the Harvard College Observatory and its Great Refractor, at that time the largest telescope in the Americas. Our understanding of comets advanced dramatically in 1950 with the publication of two extraordinary papers: Whipple (then at Harvard) described the mixture of dust and ice that comprises the nuclei of comets, and Oort (Leiden University) showed that new comets enter the inner solar system from a vast, diffuse cloud surrounding the planetary system.&nbsp; Modern telescopes and spacecraft encounters provide us today with a wealth of information about comets and asteroids. We will examine these observations and learn what is known and what is inferred about the origin and structure of asteroids and comets. The students will observe with the Astronomy Laboratory&rsquo;s Clay Telescope on the roof of the Science Center. Students will take on projects, which may involve their own observing program, or which exploit existing data.",56,FRSEMR 23R,13972
The Fragmentation and Future of Protestantism,"Protestantism, perhaps paradoxically, is known for its tendency toward fragmentation as well as its powerful role in shaping what many take to be the monolithic terms of the &ldquo;Modern Western&rdquo; social imaginary: individualism, proceduralism, discipline, rationalism, and disenchantment.&nbsp; This course is designed to equip students to intelligently engage differences among Protestants and to understand both the theological and social reasons for those differences&mdash;and in so doing, to better engage the relationship between Protestantism, modernity, and the current varieties of both North American and global Protestantism.&nbsp; The course will begin by introducing students to the variety of sixteenth-century Protestant Reforms, with attention to their theological and political differences.&nbsp; It will then engage critiques of Protestantism from secularization theorists and scholars of the study of religion before finally looking at the complex contours of the contemporary landscape: the persistence and continuing rise of evangelicalism alongside the struggles of mainline Protestantism.",160,RELIGION 1481,13946
State-of-the-art Instrumentation in Environmental Sciences,"This course will showcase how novel technologies have allowed fascinating new insights into key aspects of our environment. The development of novel instrumentation, driven by technological advances, is revolutionizing the environmental sciences. The new instruments are transforming observations in many ways. For example, they introduce new observables and extend the spatial and temporal coverage and resolution of (Earth) observations. The observations are advancing our understanding of environmental science topics that are of high societal relevance (e.g., climate change and air pollution). This course will highlight how state-of-the-art instrument design has enabled these fascinating advances by focusing on the physics, chemistry, and engineering principals that are central to this success. The course will also focus on the special requirements for these instruments (e.g., ruggedness and robotic operation) resulting from their deployment in the environment on a variety of observational platforms. In addition, the course will discuss challenges associated with determination of accuracy of instruments that are inaccessible after deployment (e.g., on satellites or oceanic probes).",51,ENG-SCI 166,14006
Literature as History in South Asia,"What can we learn about the history of modern South Asia from its literature? How have scholars read fiction and autobiography as an archive of the nation, gender, and colonialism? This seminar will explore several iconic as well as lesser known regional texts from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will read these in conjunction with a body of historiography that methodologically and theoretically engages with literature as an important source for understanding the making of modern South Asia. Finally, we will consider how history-writing also developed as a contested genre of literature in the colonial and post-colonial periods.

In entertainment, in ritual, in public display, in social encounters, dance, dancers and dancing are impacting, they work.&nbsp; Performers, arts patrons, scholars and critics bring particular vantage points on dance and dancing, illuminating in their own way the role that embodied practices have in human lifeways. In this &ldquo;movement seminar,&rdquo; we will bring together dance-inspired movement exercises, scholarly texts, and film to consider how dance as ritual, as arts performance and as a means and mode of articulating social belonging might also be understood as a form of productive labor. Bringing critical analyses of dance practices from around the world in conversation with theories of labor and production, we will explore how dance and dancing might bring to light new avenues for anthropological thinking about human social life.",6,ANTHRO 1870,13950
